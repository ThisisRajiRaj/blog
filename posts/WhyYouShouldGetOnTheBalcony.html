  “Who can be silent for five minutes?”, a friend had been thrown this
  challenge on the table.
</p>
<p>
  We were out late one night when someone mentioned a silent retreat his
  friend had been on. In this retreat,everyone had to be silent – no
  communication, online or offline – from dawn to dusk. A pretty tough
  challenge for our group, given our conversation never ceased. Casual
  banter, ribbing each other, laughing hysterically at inside jokes were
  all part of any evening together.
</p>
<p>
  But two of us took up the challenge. A timer was set and we became
  quiet.&nbsp;At the end, though, it was not clear what anyone would gain
  from intentionally remaining silent for any length of time.
</p>
<p>This is when I remembered the idea of “getting on the balcony”.</p>
<p>
  I first encountered the concept of “getting off the dance floor, and on
  the balcony” at a leadership retreat at Microsoft. The instructor had
  said:
  <strong>
    To be an effective leader, you should not always be in the fray or on
    the dance floor.
  </strong>
  Three reasons why:
</p>
<p>
  1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Humans love to feel heard and
  understood. Research shows that less than half of anything anyone says
  is properly understood. But more importantly, only 7% of our
  communication is verbal. Given these stats, and the importance to
  relationships in day-to-day life, it makes sense to be quiet and try to
  carefully understand others first.
</p>
<p>
  2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you constantly keep throwing your two
  cents in, people’s real thoughts and opinions can get masked or biased.
  Inclusive environments where everyone’s true opinions are heard yield
  better results. This is especially important if you’re a senior leader
  in an organization, and people could feel an unspoken pressure to “fall
  in line”.
</p>
<p>
  3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You need to be centered yourself to act
  in emotionally intelligent ways. Our biology is wired to constantly scan
  our environment for threats and rewards. Any signal goes through our
  primal brain centers first, and if you do not act from a place of calm
  awareness, you run the risk of making poor decisions triggered from
  quick emotional reactions.
</p>
<p>
  You cannot stay on the balcony forever, though. Action is important for
  progress and a leader needs to act. But occasionally stepping on the
  balcony before acting can lead to better decisions and a healthy
  workplace.
</p>
<p>
  So how exactly do you get on the balcony? Checking in with yourself is a
  required first step. You need to understand your emotional state, and
  regulate it, before you can understand the emotional state of others. I
  find that taking three deep breaths and focusing inward is good way to
  settle in.
</p>
<p>
  Then you observe. Pay close attention to everything happening around
  you, what everyone is saying and more importantly what they are not
  saying. Watch their body language and gauge the level of comfort they
  have in a situation. If needed, lean back physically to signal to your
  brain that you are stepping out of the fray for a bit.
</p>
<p>
  Resisting the urge to say something and always act is a skill that needs
  to learned and kept sharp. Practices like meditation and silent retreats
  can in fact help develop this skill. The more often you take yourself
  off the fray, the more easily it comes to you in tense situations.

  Next time something intense and important is going on in your team
  (or your life), get on the balcony. You’ll be surprised how
  different and lucid the perspective is from there.

  <i>But first let's practice: can you be silent for five minutes today? How
    about two?</i>
