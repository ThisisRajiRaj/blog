  One warm afternoon, as I was sitting on the sandy shores of Morro Bay
  beach watching tides come in and out, I thought about the oft-repeated
  advice: <strong>do what makes you happy. </strong>
</p>
<p>
  It was the tail end of December and I would soon be welcoming the new
  year. Perfect time and location for some introspection. What is
  happiness? More importantly, what is MY happiness?
</p>
<p>
  Many researchers and philosophers have tried to come up with a
  definition for happiness.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    It is having a surplus of positive feelings throughout your life.
  </li>
  <li>It is filling your life with meaning.</li>
  <li>It is sampling a variety of diverse experiences.</li>
  <li>
    It is fitting nicely into the jigsaw puzzle of your family and
    community.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Scour the bookshelves of your local library, and you will find a
  plethora of books dedicated to this topic. It is clear that happiness
  is important to us humans. What is not clear is – what is it, how do
  you get it and how do you keep it.
</p>
<p>
  For one thing, happiness is not a feeling of high. Our biology is not
  wired for a high feeling to last. The setpoint of our emotional state
  had to be in the center for us to go in search of high feelings that
  prolonged life. A constantly high emotional state meant we wouldn't
  seek out the pleasures of life vital for our continued existence.
</p>
<p>
  Everyone's center is different, of course - some people are naturally
  more buoyant than others - but our individual highs cannot be
  permanent. Eating delightful foods, finding yourselves valued or
  admired may light up the pleasure centers of your brain, but this
  feeling won’t last.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    The pursuit of happiness then is a pursuit of your center
  </strong>
  , the place where you feel a sense of well-being and peace. Finding
  your happiness is finding this center.
</p>
<p>
  That December day, work and life worries far away from my mind, my
  emotions were at their setpoint for well-being. I took a moment to
  reflect on what this center felt like. This was the emotional state I
  wanted to sustain.
  <strong>
    Staying happy, I realized, is the act of noticing when my emotional
    state dips below this center and actively moving it back up
  </strong>
  . What does that entail?
</p>
<p>
  A tiny plover tiptoed along the shore. I took out my journal and
  scribbled down a list - a list of actions that can bring back my
  emotional state to my setpoint. My very own “happiness list”. Here are
  some items from it…
</p>
<p>
  -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Setting myself
  a tough goal and accomplishing it
</p>
<p>
  -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gaining new
  insights from a good book
</p>
<p>
  -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sitting quietly
  with my thoughts and feeling my breath
</p>
<p>
  -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Writing in my
  journal. Writing, in general
</p>
<p>
  -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listening to
  music in complete darkness
</p>
<p>
  Next time I find myself unhappy, these actions, I know, can bring me
  back to my center.
</p>
<p>
  Everyone needs to know what this list is for themselves. Are you ready
  to write yours?
