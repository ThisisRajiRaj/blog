<b>W</b>hen I was growing up, breakfast on most days was rice mixed with curd,
    served with a tiny piece of pickled mango on the side. On days when I was
    lucky, it was crispy, golden-brown crepes called <em>dosas</em>, served with
    spicy coconut chutney. Some days it was <em>rotis</em> with a side of some
easy-to-whip-up curry, or a piece of toast slathered with <em>mixed-fruit kissan</em> jam. 
But rarely did we have cereal with milk. Cereal was just not a thing where I grew up.
</p>
<p>
    When I moved to America, cereal breakfasts would become among the first
    habits I'd adopt from my new homeland. I would in fact become a fan of this
    kind of breakfast, one you can arrange by simply ripping open a bag over a bowl,
    and pouring cold milk straight from your fridge. So convenient. No sweat, no fuss.
</p>
<p>
    Over the years I'd adopt many more things from America. Taking hot
    baths in a bathtub, eating peanut butter in a dozen different ways, saying
    "love you" to the people I loved, saying hello to strangers on the street,
    doing weekly instead of daily grocery runs...things I didn't use to do back
    home and now suddenly appearing as natural as sleeping under the stars. Of
    course I didn't adopt many other things in my new world: my husband and I
    still share a single car, though we live in a house with a two-car garage
    in a leafy suburb, part of the famous American dream. I didn't adopt the
    tradition of hosting a Christmas tree at home, though we adopted taking
    time off to reflect and recharge over Christmas. I didn't adopt the habit
    of the almost religious consumerism right after Thanksgiving, though we did
    adopt Thanksgiving as a tradition.

    In previous years, I had spent Thanksgiving days baking pies using recipes
    found online, making tofu casseroles, and vacuuming the house just before
    folks arrived. I had spent evenings huddled around tables with friends and
    (sometimes) family, the sound of clattering plates and laughter filling the room. 
    We had spent time
    talking about things we were each thankful for that year. I had gone to bed
    with a full heart and a fuller stomach.
    <br/>
</p>
<p>
    This year, 2020, was understandably different. We didn't have friends or
    family with us this year. My father was staying with his little sister in a
    small town in India. My mother-in-law was in Chennai, hunkering down to let
    the pandemic and the latest cyclone from the Bay of Bengal pass. My brother
    and my brother-in-law's families were thousands of miles away, in different
    cities. Our friends would be staying in their respective homes, spending
    the evening in a low-key way. This year, as we are doing with everything
    else - work, kids' school, working out, eating healthy - we would just have to do our best
    with what we have. And one of "the best of what I had" this year,
    on Thanksgiving Day, would be my morning run.

    <b>T</b>hanksgiving Day 2020 dawned crisp and bright in Seattle. I drove to the
    parking lot of a trail in Redmond and began my run. On the trail, sallow
    maple leaves, as large as palm leaves, had created a soft bed for my steps. As I 
    ran, I could hear the soft squelch of the leaves getting muddled under my feet.
    "What was I thankful for?" I reflected as I moved forward. 2020 had been hard, no question
    about it, but there was also much in my life that I could count as blessings.
</p>
<p>
    First what a wonder it was that I could be out there that morning, able to
    run. So many things had to be going right in my life just for that
    seemingly mundane thing to happen. My body was cooperating, no niggling
    aches and pains, no illness I was fighting off. I had the resources to
    drive a car. I had the privilege to be able to take myself off and spend
    time on my physical and mental health. I was living in a place where I
    could run alone without worrying for my safety. Things I had not been able
    to do at other times in my life, and things that many folks are around the
    world are unable to do.

    I stopped for a breath and glanced around, taking in the natural beauty.
    The quiet lake looked like an ironed grey linen sheet. The trees by the lake
    glowed red, red as apples. I felt lucky to be living in this beautiful
    place. I continued reflecting. I had not just a job, but a team I loved and
    believed in. I had a loving husband, and a father I still called for advice
    on sticky matters.

            Most importantly, I still had my breath, in, out, in,
            out, pooling in front of my face that cold morning. What a wonderful thing it was to be here,
            to be moving, to be breathing, to be alive. No matter where one is with
            one's life situation, our breath is something we can all feel
            thankful for. Just to be alive is a miracle and a gift!

    Big things in our lives, like getting married, having a child, getting
    promoted at work, are easy to get excited about. Everyday things, on the
    other hand, escape notice until they are not there anymore. All one must do
    to notice them better, I realized, is to simply stop and imagine a day when they may not
    be there anymore. When my dad might not be there to call for advice, when I
    might not have the ability to drive a car by myself, when I simply might
    not be able to tie up my shoelaces and go for a runâ€¦these everyday things 
    are what make up the stuff of my life, what truly enrich
    me.
</p>
<p>
    I hope that, after the hard year we have just had, we all remember to take
    the time to appreciate these simple, everyday things. Not just on Thanksgiving Day, but
    on every day of the year. Whether it is during a daily run, or when we feel
    water rushing over our fingers as we wash our face in the morning, or as we
    taste the sweetness of our breakfast cereal, let's ask ourselves what our life would be 
    like if we didn't have that blessing. A grateful life is indeed a happier life.
