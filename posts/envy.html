    <em>What is your first reaction when you hear that your friend, a peer, just got promoted?
    Do you feel as though a crummy little
    rat is scratching with its crummy little paws at the insides of your stomach? Do
    you feel an unbearable sense of shame and disappointment with yourself?</em>
</p>
<p>
    This was the topic of a recent conversation. It was a stormy Friday evening in December. The
    wind outside was hurling buckets of rainwater at my windows. After a long
    week filled with meetings, I had one last one-on-one before
    I slithered away into my weekend. My one-on-one was with a young woman
    that I mentor at work, whom we shall call Ashley. Ashley had just heard that
    her friend - someone she had graduated with from college - was getting promoted
    to the Principal level at Microsoft. When she heard the news, Ashley mouthed words 
    of congrats to her friend. Then she quickly turned on herself. She felt bad about her own
    progress. Turning a glaring white spotlight on herself, she wondered,
    why am I not as successful as him?
</p>
<p>
    As soon as she asked that question, she became suffused with unpleasant
    feelings. Her head clouded up, she lost interest in her work, and she even
    questioned if she belonged in this field at all. What began as a friendly
    conversation between her and her friend threatened to become a crisis in her career. 
    But Ashley was keen enough to notice her tobogganing descent
    into this unhappy place. She braked hard. She realized she had to stop the
    slide and stop feeling bad. That's when she called me.
</p>
<br/>
<h5>
    "Have you felt this way, comparing yourself to others?" she asked me, "and
    if so, how did you deal with it?"
</h5>
<p>
    I decided to write about this topic today because it is not just Ashley that struggles with 
    it. 
    This topic, unsurprisingly, comes up a lot in my conversations. There are, of course, 
    many nefarious reasons why some people - especially the ones that are more introverted,  
    that are minorties in tech - get recognized less than others. But Ashley was not there to 
    talk about these systemic issues in the 
    industry. She was asking me a personal question for a personal problem. She wanted to 
    talk about her own state of mind. How she was 
    reacting to her friend's news and what she can do about it.
</p>
<p>A lot of us in our industry have been schooled in competition and we revel in it. Our schools grade us on
    a curve - only one boy or girl could hold the highest rank in class. Our
    teachers pin little stars in our notebooks when we do well. We get little
    trinkets to celebrate our excellence. There can only be one winner in most
    sports, and that winner gets all the glory. Slowly, this engineering shapes
    us like moving currents shape rocks in their path. Many of us come to
    believe that external validation is what makes us worthy. We crave the
    adult version of those stars and trinkets: promotions, kudos, followers on
    social media, and so on. We feel a pang in our hearts when a friend buys a
    second house, and we are still living in a rental apartment. We simper when
    someone announces they got promoted, all the while feeling a hard nub of
    ache in our hearts. We compare constantly: is her child doing better than
    mine? Is she slimmer than me? Is he more liked? Does his car signal luxury
    more than mine? The list goes on.

    Have I ever felt envy?
</h5>
<p>
    You can bet that I have.

<p>We all have childhood stories that our families
    love to repeat like a playlist on loop. One such story in my family is of
    me and my brother and a little cup of steaming chocolate drink. Growing up,
    my brother was the "difficult" child in our household, and I was the "easy"
    one. Naturally, my mother spent more time doting on him, and naturally, I
    felt ignored. The story goes that I began to feel resentful and envious of
    him. One fine morning, when my brother was ten and I was four, I saw him
    nursing his hot chocolate drink in our dark living room. I toddled over to
    him, grabbed his drink, and tipped it straight over this head. It must have
    blanched his delicate skin. He jumped up, ran around the room like an
    excited dog, wailing and crying for our mom. Mom came running, and all I
    remember after that were the blows that rained hard on my back.
</p>
<p>
    In my later years too, I have compared myself to others. But I have also
    come to realize that envy is generally an unproductive, irrational emotion.
</p>
<p>
    Let's think: how does your envy REALLY help? There are emotions that can
    rattle you into action. When you feel angry, for example, you might be
    railing against an injustice that needs to be corrected. Your anger can
    spur you to do that. Love could be a compass pointing to safety, comfort,
    and other good things in life. But envy? It generally makes you feel bad
    about yourself and gets your blood pressure to rise. Your future actions
    get muddled and your hopes diminish. Rarely do you become more biased
    toward action because of envy.
</p>
<br/>
<h5>
    So how do I deal with this futile emotion?
</h5>
<p>
    Firstly, like Ashley did, I <strong>become aware</strong> of what is going
    on inside me. I give myself a time-out and go sit quietly with my breath.
    Maybe for ten minutes, maybe for twenty. I breathe in, breathe out, and
    watch the emotion spread in my mind like a drop of black ink spilled on
cream paper. Then I <strong>resolve to let the feeling go and reason over it</strong>. I tell
    myself why the emotion doesn't make any sense. My journey in life is
    distinct and different from anyone else's. Comparing my journey to others' is
    like comparing Jane Eyre's professional progress with Lisbeth Salander's. 
    It's just absurd. There are things I have that others don't, and
    vice versa, and that is ok. I am running my own marathon, and not someone else's. 
    Moreover, feeling envy cannot do anything for
    the status quo. It won't bring magically lift me up or make my suffering
    disappear. In fact, quite the opposite.
</p>
<p>
    At this point, it also helps for me to remember where my value as a person
    comes from. I didn't believe this in my teens or my 20s or even my 30s, but
    I now know more deeply than ever that <u>my value comes from within</u>.
    All those external trinkets and badges had trained me to believe otherwise,
    but I am a valuable person regardless of my status in life, my number of
    cars, the number of pearls in jewel box, the number of friends I have, and
    so on. I have talents that I have developed over the years. I have battled
    hardships and won many victories against them. I have skills, knowledge,
    and abilities that I have used to help others. I try to be a good human, I
    try to show love to the people around me, and I try to treat this planet
with respect. I remind myself of all of that and <strong>affirm to myself</strong> that 
    <em>
        "I am enough; strong enough, smart enough, thin enough, eloquent enough,
        interesting enough, clever enough, rich enough. I am just <u>enough</u>."
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    I listened to Ashley and told her that she was not a bad person for feeling
    the way she was feeling. It is only human to feel, and feelings come
    packaged like snack boxes. There are snacks in the box that are good for you 
    - like nuts and chocolates - and there are snacks you might do
    well to avoid - like hard candies and buttery cookies. The key is to
    distinguish them and attempt to subdue the ones that are destructive.
    Awareness, letting go, reasoning, and affirmation are steps that can help
    you with that.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
    When I ended the call with Ashley, the storm outside had abated and a
    surreal quiet had descended on the streets. I knew Ashley was already on
    the first step to mastering her emotion. She had become aware of what she
    was feeling and why that was bad. Now onward to the next steps. I wished
    her luck and we said goodbye.
