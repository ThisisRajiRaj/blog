    Their names were Yasmin and Fatima. Yasmin, the eldest, was fifteen years
    old. Fatima was fourteen. Yasmin and Fatima's parents had rented out a
    place to my dad, when he worked in a small South Indian town called Salem.
    I visited Salem for the first time during my summer break of 1992, which
    was when I first met Yasmin and Fatima.
</p>

<p>
    The girls fascinated me. They had delicate skin, skin that would turn the
    color of rose milk in the blistering heat of Salem. If you looked closely,
    you could see the fibers of pink veins on their cheeks. They
    had lush curly hair, and brilliant irises flecked with chestnut brown.
    Truth be told, I was slightly intimidated by them. They were rich girls
    that had an air of self-assurance about them. What more, they were 
    posh, classy, with beautiful fair skin that - my
    upbringing and my culture had taught me - made them better than me.
</p>
<p>
    But a bored 15-year-old on a summer break, with no books to read, is no match for
    intimidation. One day, I worked up the courage to talk to them. We quickly
    became friends. Many afternoons that summer, I spent in their warm company.
    They told me about all the local customs, shared neighborhood gossip,
    complained about their parents, talked about boys. We ate roasted peanuts
    from paper cones, sitting with our legs folded beneath us. I felt thrilled
    that they <em>chose</em> to be my friends, that they <em>chose</em> to
    share their stories with me. As the time came for me to leave Salem, I
    started feeling a pang in my heart. I knew I'd miss Yasmin and Fatima.
</p>
<p>
    A few days before I left, though, Fatima found me alone in our common
    backyard. I had been sent by my grandma to bring in the clothes that were
    drying on our clothesline. The clothes felt hot to touch and crackling dry.
    Fatima approached me as I was trying to get a handle on my grandma's sari.
</p>
<h5>
    "My sister is going to get married," she said, without much ado.

        This picture is from a Bollywood movie, but Yasmin's wedding 
        was supposedly an affair to remember.
    </figcaption>

<br/>
<p>
    I looked at her, confused. Yasmin was just 15-years old, a high schooler
    like me. Even though I had been brought up in a very traditional family
    myself, the fact didn't compute in my head. But Fatima didn't feel anything
    odd about the arrangement. She had come there to just convey the news to
    me, not to bemoan what was happening.
</p>
<p>
    Later, my dad told me that it was not uncommon for "girls like Fatima and
    Yasmin" to get married before they finished school. By that he meant girls
    in small towns, girls with parents that kept the old ways of old religions,
    girls with parents that were not very educated themselves. In the case of
    Yasmin, her family just wanted her married before she became
    "unmarketable". Older, more educated girls were deemed more trouble, and
    therefore less desirable. A woman who worked not just took away a job that
    was rightfully a man's, but her character could be thrown into question
    too.
</p>
<p>
    In the end, I didn't attend Yasmin's wedding. I had to leave Salem before
    then. But my dad told me that the wedding was a lavish affair. Yasmin
    sparkled with rows of gold necklaces around her neck. Over a thousand
    guests attended. Yasmin dropped out of school and was misty-eyed when she
    left her father's home, but she was happy. She had achieved one of the
    biggest goals that she had been trained to pursue: make yourself attractive
    enough for someone of good status to marry you. Yasmin and Fatima weren't
    encouraged to have dreams beyond that. Most of their lives, their work
    would be the traditional kind that goes unpaid: the work of a mother, the
    work of a homemaker, the work of a caretaker for the elderly.
</p>
<h5>
    It was not just Yasmin and Fatima who left me with the nagging question of
    "why are they not going to school/college?"
</h5>
<p>
    Before I was five, my mother had the habit of leaving me in the care of our
    servant Meenakshi, a skinny woman with a dark face that was shriveled like
    a raisin. Meenakshi lived in a shanty by a canal filled with flotsam. Her
    house had one room where her family slept, cooked, and bathed. I spent many
    an afternoon in her home, wrapped in the smells of onions and old oil.
    Meenakshi became like a mother to me. She often fed me Tamarind rice,
    mixing spicy homemade tamarind paste with cold rice. She was a poor woman
    with a heart as large as the ocean.

    She had a 10-year daughter Lalli who played with me and told me stories
    while her mother cooked. Lalli never went to school, would never go to
    school in her life. Sometimes she would run her hands over my notebooks
    wrapped in crisp, brown paper, and take a whiff of the insides of my books.
    But she never once said she longed to go to school herself. When Lalli was
    fifteen, she was sent off to be the live-in help for someone in Delhi. I
    never thought of it then but have frequently done so after. How could
    someone like Lalli ever expect to escape the life she found herself in? How
    could she become someone who could go to school and then college and then
    off to a job that would pay her well?
</p>
<p>
    My own childhood was not something I'd describe as a cakewalk. I grew up
    having to argue to do things that I wanted to do: to study, to study
    furthermore, to have a career and so on. In my family, women were always an
    afterthought. We ate after all the menfolk had finished eating. I washed my
    brother's and my dad's dinnerplates, clattering them over our stone sink.
    My brother was expected to just do his homework, whereas I was expected to
    help around the house - and only after that, do my homework. In college, I
    was told that I was wasting a "seat" in class that a boy deserved more. But
    still, I had my guardian angels. My dad believed in my right to an
    education. He believed that I could make something of myself, besides being
    a mother and a wife. He stood by my side against everyone who questioned my
    right to be "so studious". One of my aunts - a role model - inspired me to
    pursue a career. We had money enough to afford books, notebooks, pens, and
    uniforms.
</p>
<p>
    Lalli didn't have any of that. Her family expected her to bring in money
    when she was a child, not spend it on schools and books. I could see how people like Lalli - 
    marginalized, mistreated, abandoned by society - could find it hard to escape
     the vicious vortex she was in. I saw how Yasmin didn't have
     role models of career women, or even people that encouraged her to pursue a career, around her.
</p>
<p>
    I have lost touch with Lalli, Yasmin, and Fatima. Meenakshi is now dead. I
    look back on my friendship with them today because someone recently asked
    me why I feel so strongly about Diversity and Inclusion in my line of work.
</p>
<h5>
    So why do I feel so strongly about Diversity and Inclusion?
</h5>
<br/>
<p>
    Because I know that including everyone's potential in our workplace will
    make for more innovation and better products.
</p>
<p>
    Because I know that it is better for our economy to not leave hordes of
    people and their productivity out.
</p>
<p>
    Because I know that the world will be a better place to have everyone
    lifted.
</p>
<p>
    Because I know a solid education empowers people like few other things, and
    empowered people can make big things happen for humanity.
</p>
<p>
    But more than any of thatâ€¦I feel the struggles that people in the margins face 
    in my bones - in the <b>marrow</b> of my bones. Girls that must defeat not
    just the voices of society, but their own inner voices, to be in
    male-dominated fields. Children that do not have the luxury of playing on
    their Xboxes in the evenings. Children that must work to fund not just
    their education, but that of their siblings too. Girls that are expected by
    society to get married when they are barely adults, and if they become
    professionals at all, it must have been after a wearying trek. Women like
    my own mother-in-law who, even though she was bringing in a fair share of
    her family's income, even though she working hard from eight to five, was
    expected to do 100% of the unpaid labor at home. I know about the odds
    stacked against people like them, the people on the margins of our world. I
    know it is the morally right thing to do to empower and make sure they have a seat at the table.
</p>
<p>
    My father once advised me that I should not take up the cause of women or
    marginalized people. His advice, of course, came from a good place. He
    didn't want me to suffer any adverse consequences at work because of any
    kind of crusade I sent myself on. But this is a cause that is important.
    Important to all of us because of all the reasons above, and important to
    me <u>deeply</u>, because of who I am, where I come from, and everything
    that has made me.
