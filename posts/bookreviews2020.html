    If you know anything about me, you know about my love for books. Books
    offer me inspiration, escape, entertainment, advice, and
    so much more.

<p>
    2020 has been an <i>annus horribilis</i> in many respects. But for reading, it has been a godsend. 
    It has given me more time to read. I have read
    <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/22430567">
        21 books so far</a>, 
    and I started many more than I finished. Here are five books I read
    recently and my comments on them.

<h4>
    Enlightenment Now by Stephen Pinker
</h4>
<p>
    
    <a
        href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073TJBYTB/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1"
    >

    </a>
</p>
<p>
    At close to 600 pages, and a deluge of data, this is not a fast read. The
    book is a paean to the Enlightenment movement of the 1800s, the movement
    that gave us ideas like democracy, capitalism, equal
    rights, and science, that modern life is built on. Like he did in 
    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0052REUW0/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1">
        The Better Angels of our Nature</a>, the author wades through a lot of data to make
    the point that, contrary to popular belief, the world is better today than
    it has ever been. That is thanks to the progress we have made with science
    and a way of looking at the world that the Enlightenment movement birthed.
</p>
<p>
    As I read the book, I found myself
    agreeing with and arguing with the author in turns. Yes, I agree that we
    have more peace now than a century ago. Yes, I agree that global inequality
    is declining. But, no, I don't agree that nuclear power is safer than other forms of power, just 
    because we haven't seen as many fatalities with nuclear power generation yet. No, we can't
    simply dismiss the claim that there is systemic racism in the US because
    the data shows that cops shoot white and black people in equal rates.
    Still, I learned new things from the book - e.g., Climate Engineering is a
    thing - and any book that teaches you new things is worth your time.

    <blockquote>
        <p>
            "To the Enlightenment thinkers the escape from ignorance and superstition
            showed how mistaken our conventional wisdom could be, and how the methods
            of science-skepticism, fallibilism, open debate, and empirical testing-are
            a paradigm of how to achieve reliable knowledge." - Steven Pinker

<h4>
    Waking Up by Sam Harris
</h4>
<p>

    When I lived in Canada, I spent some time exploring various religions. I
    was trying to find one that was not steeped in rituals like the ones I had grown 
    up with. Buddhism and its spiritual philosophy
    stole my attention. I started practicing meditation and taking part in
    Buddhist meditation meetups. But very soon, I got disenchanted. The practice of
    Buddhism seemed to have veered away from the purely spiritual to
    the frustratingly ritualistic. 
</p>
<p>When I read Waking Up by Sam Harris, I was
    reminded of what it was that drew me to Buddhism in the
    first place. It was Spirituality without Religion. A way to calm your mind,
    and understand yourself, without having to practice a hundred ways to
    circle a statue. Sam Harris's scientific background
    helps him stay close to sound principles and rational explanations of the Buddhist
    philosophy. If like me, you appreciate spirituality without the noise of
    the supernatural elements, you will enjoy this book.

            "There is now little question that how one uses one's attention, moment to
            moment, largely determines what kind of person one becomes. Our minds-and
            lives-are largely shaped by how we use them." - Sam Harris

<h4>
    The Evening and the Morning by Ken Follett
</h4>
<p>
    
    <a
        href="https://www.amazon.com/Evening-Morning-Kingsbridge-Book-ebook/dp/B081Y47NRW"
    >
        Amazon
    </a>
</p>
<p>
    My first Ken Follett book was <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003GK21JO/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1">
        The Pillars of the Earth</a>, a 1000+ page novel
    about a community of English townspeople building a cathedral in the middle
    ages. The book was so well-written and researched that I instantly became a
    fan. Subsequently, I tried to enjoy many sequels by the author. I am sad to
    say, I was consistently disappointed. 
</p>
<p>When I learned about his latest book,
    The Evening and the Morning, I let myself hope once more. Thie
    book is a prequel to The Pillars of the Earth, and I hoped like I would
    hope for a sunny day in the middle of winter that it would be good. Alas,
    once again, I was disappointed. 
</p>
<p>The book is still a fast read.
    You learn about the beginning of the middle ages - replete with Viking
    attacks, corrupt priests, brothels teeming with STDs, highway men, slaves,
    and LOTS and LOTS of physical and sexual violence. Despite getting all that
    right, somehow, Follett manages to screw it up. There are many
    anachronistic and unbelievable characters, too much pedestrian writing, and
    predictable plotlines. I'd recommend the book only if we you want to escape
    to a different century (which you might, given it is 2020), or looking for
    a quick read. For me, it is a 3 out of 5 stars, and even that is a stretch.

<h4>
    Upheaval by Jared Diamond
</h4>


<p>
      <a
        href="https://www.amazon.com/Upheaval-Turning-Points-Nations-Crisis-ebook/dp/B07H2997W4"
    >

    </a>
</p>
<p>
    Jared Diamond is another author that doesn't quite do it for me. I enjoy
    learning about different cultures and the anthropological journeys of
    various peoples from his books. I tried very hard to like his "Guns, Germs,
    and Steel". But, to me, he oversimplifies, and like Pinker, uses data
    selectively to make his points. His writing rambles and I find myself
    wishing he had employed an editor. 
</p>
<p>In Upheaval, Diamond reviews six
    countries (Finland, Japan, Chile, Indonesia, Australia, United States) that
    have gone through various crises at different times in history. His
    approach is to draw parallels between personal crises and national crises
    and use a psychological way of analyzing national upheavals. I learned new things in the book, for sure:
    about Finland's attitude toward Russia, about Meiji Japan and how they
    handled a predatory, imperialist West, about the racist origins of
    Australia and so on. However, his repetitive 12-step analysis of crisis factors grated on me,
    and I was tempted to skim through much of it. </p>
    <p>Many people
    I respect, including Bill Gates, adore Diamond's work. Give the
    book a read to see if you do.

<h4>
    The Splendid and the Vile by Erik Larson
</h4>
<p>
    <a
        href="https://www.amazon.com/Splendid-Vile-Churchill-Family-Defiance-ebook/dp/B07TRVW6V"
    >
        Amazon
    </a>
</p>
<p>
    The Splendid and the Vile is a non-fiction book about the years 1940-41
    during the worst bombings of England by the Nazi Germany. 
    Erik Larson's writing is stellar. Churchill comes across as a strong if
    a somewhat eccentric leader who led his nation to victory despite the
    momentous odds against it. Unlike Abraham Lincoln in the Team of Rivals,
    Churchill surrounds himself with allies and trusted supporters. Tea
    is legendary for strengthening English will, but Churchill strengthens England
    with words. He gives the English people lots of beautiful, strong, carefully crafted
    words, spoken dramatically on BBC radio addresses. The words rally the nation.
</p>

<div style="border-style:double;border-color:black;padding:10px">
    <blockquote>
       
<p>
    "I have nothing to offer but blood, sweat, and tears," he pronounces in one
    of his first addresses to the country, spelling out the nature of the struggle ahead. 
    "We shall not fail or
    falter; we shall not weaken or tire. Neither the sudden shock of battle,
    nor the long-drawn trials of vigilance and exertion will wear us down. Give
    us the tools, and we will finish the job," he writes to the reluctant
    president of the US Roosevelt, urging him to get involved in the war.
</p>
<p> No
    wonder Churchill came to be known as one of the best orators in history.
</p>    
        
</blockquote>
</div>

<br/>
<p>
    In the book, we also learn about his family - his free-spirited daughter
    Mary, his alcoholic son Randolph, and his rock, his wife, Clementine - and
    the parochial family dramas they find themselves in. We learn about various
    Nazi leaders and their mania. The war never feels decided. Just when it
    looks like England got a drubbing in a Blitz aerial attack, the English
    come back with valor. It's fascinating to follow these events in the book.
    If you are a lover of good writing, or you enjoy reading about leadership,
    or you like to read about World War 2 history, I recommend this book to
    you.
