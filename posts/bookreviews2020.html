    If you know anything about me, you know about my love for books. Books
    offer me peace, inspiration, escape, entertainment, advice, and
    so much more. A few months ago, when I scared myself into thinking that I
    might have caught COVID, I began imagining what would I do if I had to be
    quarantined and cannot work. Very prominently, my kindle featured in my
    imagination. I even worried if the hospital workers would try to bar me
    from taking my kindle with me. That felt more catastrophic than being
    caught on a snowy mountain with no sweater to keep warm.

    2020 has been a great year for catching up on reading. I have read
    <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/22430567">
        21 books so far
    </a>
    , and I have started many more than I finished. Here are five books I read
    recently and my comments on them.
</p>
<h3>
    Enlightenment Now by Stephen Pinker
</h3>
<p>

<p>
    At close to 600 pages, and a deluge of data, this is not a fast read. The
    book is a paean to the Enlightenment movement of the 1800s, the movement
    that gave us institutions and ideas like democracy, capitalism, equal
    rights, and science that modern life is built on. Like he did in The Better
    Angels of our Nature, the author walks us through rivers of data to make
    the point that, contrary to popular belief, the world is better today than
    it has ever been. That is thanks to the progress we have made with science
    and a way of looking at the world that the Enlightenment movement birthed.
    To me, the book was wonderful and annoying in parts. I found myself
    agreeing with and arguing with the author in turns. Yes, I agree that we
    have more peace now than a century ago. Yes, I agree that global inequality
    is declining. But, no, I don't agree that nuclear power should be developed
    without what he calls the "red tape" in the United States. No, we can't
    simply dismiss the claim that there is systemic racism in the US because
    the data shows that cops shoot white and black people with equal frequency.
    Still, I learned new things from the book - e.g., Climate Engineering is a
    thing - and any book that teaches you new things is worth your time.

    "To the Enlightenment thinkers the escape from ignorance and superstition
    showed how mistaken our conventional wisdom could be, and how the methods
    of science-skepticism, fallibilism, open debate, and empirical testing-are
    a paradigm of how to achieve reliable knowledge."

<h3>
    Waking Up by Sam Harris
</h3>
<p>
    
    <br/><br/>

    Back when I lived in Canada, I spent time exploring various religions. I
    was trying to find one that was not steeped in rituals, and that appealed
    to my logical side even slightly. Buddhism and its spiritual philosophy
    stole my attention. I started practicing meditation and taking part in
    Buddhist meditation meetups. Very soon, I got disenchanted. The practice of
    Buddhism - even in the West - had veered away from the purely spiritual to
    frustratingly ritualistic. When I read Waking Up by Sam Harris, I was
    reminded of what it was that enamored me to Buddhist philosophy in the
    first place. It was spirituality without religion. A way to calm your mind,
    and understand yourself, without having to practice a hundred ways to
    circle a statue. I learned many new things from the book - the
    "non-essence" of a human, e.g., that can help you to stop ascribing an
    unchanging personality to individuals. Sam Harris's scientific background
    keeps him stay close to sound principles and explanations of the Buddhist
    philosophy. If like me, you appreciate spirituality without the noise of
    the supernatural elements in it, you will enjoy this book.

    "There is now little question that how one uses one's attention, moment to
    moment, largely determines what kind of person one becomes. Our minds-and
    lives-are largely shaped by how we use them."

<h3>
    The Evening and the Morning by Ken Follett
</h3>
<p>
    
    <br/><br/>
<img className="pb-5" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/A1uwT8EHugL._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg"

    >
        Amazon
    </a>
    <br/>
</p>
<p>
    My first Ken Follett book was The Pillars of the Earth, a 1000+ page novel
    about a community of English townspeople building a cathedral in the middle
    ages. The book was so well-written and researched that I instantly became a
    fan. Subsequently, I tried to enjoy many sequels by the author. I am sad to
    say, I was consistently disappointed. When I learned about his latest book,
    The Evening and the Morning, however, I let myself hope once more. Thie
    book is a prequel to The Pillars of the Earth, and I hoped like I would
    hope for a sunny day in the middle of winter that it would be good. Alas,
    once again, I was left with disappointment. The book is still a fast read.
    You learn about the beginning of the middle ages - replete with Viking
    attacks, corrupt priests, brothels teeming with STDs, highway men, slaves,
    and LOTS and LOTS of physical and sexual violence. Despite getting all that
    right, somehow, Follett manages to screw it up. There are many
    anachronistic and unbelievable characters, too much pedestrian writing, and
    predictable plotlines. I'd recommend the book only if we you want to escape
    to a different century (which you might, given it is 2020), or looking for
    a quick read. For me, it is 3 out of 5 stars, and even that is a stretch.

<h3>
    Upheaval by Jared Diamond
</h3>


<p>
    <br/><br/>

<p>
    Jared Diamond is another author that quite doesn't do it for me. I enjoy
    learning about different cultures and the anthropological journeys of
    various peoples from his books. I tried very hard to like his "Guns, Germs,
    and Steel". But, to me, he oversimplifies, and like Pinker, uses data
    selectively to make his points. His writing rambles and I find myself
    wishing he had employed an editor. In Upheaval, Diamond reviews six
    countries (Finland, Japan, Chile, Indonesia, Australia, United States) that
    have gone through various crises at different times in history. His
    approach is to draw parallels between personal crises and national crises
    and use a psychological way of analyzing national upheavals. For this, he
    uses six countries he has personally spent time in so he can talk more
    authoritatively about them. I learned new things in the book, for sure:
    about Finland's attitude toward Russia, about Meiji Japan and how they
    handled a predatory, imperialist West, about the racist origins of
    Australia and so on. However, his repetitive 12-step analysis grated on me,
    and I was tempted to skim through much of that analysis. Many people
    I respect, including Bill Gates, adore Diamond's work. Give the
    book a read to find out yourself if you do so yoyr

<h3>
    The Splendid and the Vile by Erik Larson
</h3>
<p>
    <br/><br/>
<img className="pb-5" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/9172ttNgNKL._AC_UY327_FMwebp_QL65_.jpg"

    >

    </a>
    <br/>
</p>
<p>
    The Splendid and the Vile is a non-fiction book about the years 1940-41
    during the worst bombings of England by the Nazi Germany during World War
    2. Erik Larson's writing is stellar. Churchill comes across as a strong if
    a somewhat eccentric leader who led his nation to victory despite the
    momentous odds against it. Unlike Abraham Lincoln in the Team of Rivals,
    Churchill surrounds himself with allies and trusted supporters. While tea
    is legendary for strengthening English will, Churchill strengthens England
    with words. He gives them lots of beautiful, strong, carefully crafted
    words, spoken dramatically on BBC radio addresses.
</p>
<p>
    "I have nothing to offer but blood, sweat, and tears," he pronounced in one
    of his first addresses to the country, rally everyone behind him and
    spelling out the nature of the struggle ahead. "We shall not fail or
    falter; we shall not weaken or tire. Neither the sudden shock of battle,
    nor the long-drawn trials of vigilance and exertion will wear us down. Give
    us the tools, and we will finish the job," he wrote to the reluctant
    president of the US Roosevelt, urging him to get involved in the war. No
    wonder Churchill came to be known as one of the best orators in history.
</p>
<p>
    In the book, we also learn about his family - his free-spirited daughter
    Mary, his alcoholic son Randolph, and his rock, his wife, Clementine - and
    the parochial family dramas they find themselves in. We learn about various
    Nazi leaders and their mania. The war never feels decided. Just when it
    looks like England got a drubbing in a Blitz aerial attack, the English
    come back with valor. It's fascinating to follow these events in the book.
    If you are a lover of good writing, or you enjoy reading about leadership,
    or you like to read about World War 2 history, I recommend this book to
    you.
