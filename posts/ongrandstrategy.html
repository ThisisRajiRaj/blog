	<div className="paragraph">&#8203;Broadly speaking, there are two kinds of leaders. There are the ones that stir you
		up and make you want to do epic things. And then there are the ones that are more grounded, leading quietly,
		helping you deal with the obstacles in your way. Given a choice, who would you rather follow?<br />&#8203;</div>
	<div className="paragraph">It is very tempting, and perhaps natural, for you to want to follow the former. After
		all, the first kind of leaders appeal to our emotions. They talk of big dreams and worthwhile revolutions. They
		make us forget the humdrum of our daily existence. These are the kinds of the leaders that author and history

	<div className="paragraph"><br /><span style="color:rgb(37, 37, 37)">In Berlin's discussion, a fox is someone who
			takes into her view many things - potentially contradicting details - and strives to adapt her approach to
			all of them.&nbsp;</span>&#8203;<span style="color:rgb(37, 37, 37)">&#8203;A hedgehog is someone who keeps
			one big thing in her view and inspires people toward it. She doesn't waste energy on things that can go
			wrong, the obstacles in her way. She knows it can be distracting to her followers, but in ignoring
			contradictions and hurdles, she can lead people into disasters. &#8203;A fox, on the other hand, prepares
			you well for everything you might encounter. She is adept at taking action only to the extent of her
			capabilities.&nbsp;</span><span style="color:rgb(37, 37, 37)">&#8203;What she lacks is aspirational ideas
			she can energize her followers on. She can be frustrating and demoralizing to follow. She can drown you in
			details so much so that you may not even stir into action.</span></div>

	<div className="paragraph" style="text-align:left;display:block;"><br />In his book&nbsp; "On Grand Strategy",
		Gaddis reviews leadership styles of various historical figures along that distinction. In the age of technology
		and data, he draws on Humanities to provide valuable lessons.<br /><br />Persian ruler Xerxes, for instance, was
		a hedgehog. He stirred his countrymen into an <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Persian_invasion_of_Greece" target="_blank">extraordinary
			invasion of the Greek peninsula</a>, only to have his hedgehog-like nature result<span
			style="color:rgb(37, 37, 37)">&nbsp;in impossible situations that he couldn't overcome. They lost the battle
			to the Greeks and had to slink back home.</span><br /><br />Roman emperor Octavian, on the other hand, was a
		fox. "He saw the difference, even then, between inheriting a title and mastering the art of command," Gaddis
		says in the book, "The first&nbsp; can happen overnight. The second can take a lifetime."<br /><br /><span
			style="color:rgb(37, 37, 37)">As a boy, Octavian was tutored on beekeeping, cattle breeding, crop rotation,
			and vine cultivation. He learned how to keep his feet on the ground. When he became the emperor, he came to
			rely on his sharp interpersonal and self-awareness skills to gain the loyalty of Caesar's armies.
			W</span>ith no military experience, a sickly constitution, and in opposition to the famous commander Mark
		Antony, he maneuvered with diplomacy. He saw constraints while seeking successes, and on those few occasions
		when he did lose sight of them, he quickly self-corrected. He was a natural "strategist".<br /><br /></div>

	<div className="paragraph"><br /><span style="color:rgb(37, 37, 37)">&#8203;The virgin queen Elizabeth I was another
			fox. She frequently vacillated between choices, she changed her mind a lot, she readily submitted to
			expertise, and she allowed contradictions to thrive in her realm. All of these may seem like weaknesses in a
			leader, but they were key to Elizabeth's strategy. She was in no haste to make decisions or pick sides. She
			embodied F. Scott Fitzgerald's quality for a first-rate intelligence:&nbsp; the ability to hold two opposed
			ideas in the mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function.<br /><br />Philip II, her
			counterpart in Spain, was a true hedgehog.&nbsp; He saw God's hand in what he did. That made his interests
			and God's interests inseparable. He saw everything in polarizing dichotomies - clearly wrong or clearly
			right. He didn't delegate well, and was arguably not as successful as his English counterpart in ruling his
			vast empire.<br />&#8203;</span></div>

	<div className="paragraph"><br />&#8203;Another leader that Gaddis profiles in the book is Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln
		was a fox with a strong vision. He famously said that he needed a compass for pointing to true north, but a
		compass gave him no advice about the swamps that he would encounter along the way. "If in pursuit of your
		destination, you plunge ahead, heedless of obstacles, and achieve nothing more than to sink in a swamp... What's
		the use of knowing True North?" he asked. He was an expert political animal, who kept his aspirations in the
		horizon, but didn't shy away from maneuvering and negotiating and compromising along the way.<br />&#8203;</div>

	<div className="paragraph">"&#8203;On Grand Strategy" talks about many such historical foxes and
		hedgehogs.&nbsp;<br /><br />At my company, we emphasize both fox-like and hedgehog-like qualities in what we
		look for and groom in our leaders. We want our leaders to create clarity while generating energy. Part of
		creating clarity is to synthesize the complex. To survey multiple potentially contradictory ideas while defining
		a course of action. These are very fox-like things to do. Generating energy on the other hand is about inspiring
		optimism and making people feel great about the future. These are very hedgehog-like things to
		do.<br /><br />W<span style="color:rgb(37, 37, 37)">e see a lot of hedgehogs with limited fox-like skills among
			our populist politicians today. People that talk big but have few plans to achieve their big ends. They
			offer limited details on how the capabilities at their disposal can match aspirations. These are the kinds
			of leaders Gaddis warns against in his book.&nbsp;</span>As a leader, Gaddis seems to say, you need to be
		both a fox and a hedgehog. <span style="color:rgb(37, 37, 37)">It is important for a leader to aspire to worthy
			ends, but it is equally important for him to match his means to his ends.</span>&nbsp;<br /><br />"On Grand
		Strategy" was overall an enlightening, if a plodding and difficult read. I highly recommend it, especially if
		you are looking for an insightful book to give you company in your social distancing.</div>
