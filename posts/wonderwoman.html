<p>
    I get it, you're disappointed. This year has been horrendous. And when it
    was not horrendous, it was boring as a beige wall. You deserved some riveting entertainment for your Christmas break. When
    you started watching Wonder Woman 84, you were full of hope and
    expectations. And yet the movie failed to deliver. The pacing felt jittery.
    There was too much stuff happening and yet not enough. Major plot points
    were inexplicable. Gal Gadot, an Israeli actor, was shown saving Arab
    children on the sandy streets of Egypt - a classic "white savior" move, you
    argued in your head. The streets of Washington DC in the 80s were bereft of
    black people. Whitewashed, as in many Hollywood movies. Yup, I get the
    disappointment that has been unfurled like a red carpet on social media.
</p>
<p>
    And despite all that, I found myself spellbound by the movie. Right from the opening
    scene when an astonishingly self-confident young Diana Prince, a little girl with plump cheeks, sprints
    across the green mountains of her home country, past susurrant waterfalls,
    to compete with women twice her age. Hans Zimmer's music got
    my heart racing. The action made me feel warm all over, smiling and
    clapping like a little girl.
</p>

<p>
    I felt pure joy whenever Diana transformed into Wonder Woman, swiveling her
    golden lasso, and moving as fast as a bullet. Yes, I too found the plot
    sagging and confusing in places. But overall, I enjoyed the movie and I
    recommend that you watch it. For there are things you can learn from it
    that are worth remembering. I noted at least five lessons that I find
    valuable for both my work and life.

<h5>
    1. Check your thirst for more. Think hard about what you wish for. Think
    hard about what you're giving up in return.
</h5>
<p>
    It is the classic tale of greed gone awry. We have seen it in other old
    stories. A Faustian bargain where what is given up is more valuable than
    what is acquired, even though the person making the bargain doesn't know
    that until too late. Midas's wish to turn everything he touches to gold nearly starves
    him to death. Dorian Gray's longing for eternal youth leads him to lies and
    murder. This is the central moral of WW84, and one that cannot be more
    relevant to us in our corporate world. As professionals, we can become
    inveterate box-checkers. Buy a home. Check. Get promoted at work. Check. 
    Get another home. Check. Get promoted again. Check.
    Get your first million. Check. Get another
    million. Check. Though some of this ambition is healthy, it never stops.
    The hunger for more intensifies and can lead you down some unhappy paths.
    We need to pause and think about what we long for and we're giving up in
    return in this bargain.
</p>

<h5>
    2. Empathy is essential.
</h5>

<p>
    In most superhero movies I watch, heroes embody pure good and villains
    embody pure evil. There are few nuances and few attempts made to humanize
    these black and white caricatures. In WW84, we learn a lot about the back
    story of Diana Prince. She becomes a superhero by learning in tough
    Amazonian wargames and training grounds. We see her disappointments and
    failures strengthen her. But we also see the villain Max Lord abused by his
    father. We see the villain Cheetah simper nervously as an insecure nerd.
    The lived experiences of our villains, just like those of our hero, make
    them who they are. We judge our villains less viciously once we learn what
    their beginnings were like.
</p>
<p>
    In our work and life, we often come across people that strike us as
    difficult or even evil. But we rarely think about their back stories. I
    love that WW84 shows us how empathy can be used not just with people we
    like but with people that we don't as well.

<h5>
    3. Do not be in a rush to "become great".
</h5>

<br/>

<br/>
<p>
    All too often, in our rushed world, we can't wait to be great. Not just be
    great, but also be recognized by others as great. We will take the quickest
    path to greatness, thank you very much. But as Antiope warns Diana in the
    opening scene, this haste doesn't result in excellence. You need to pace
    yourself, set expectations in your head right, listen, learn, be patient,
    and progress. Becoming outstanding at anything - whether it is stopping
    tanks with your bare feet or becoming an admired developer at a software
    company or a mellifluous singer at the Metropolitan Opera - is a process
    and takes time. Bide your time, and do not be in a rush.
</p>

<br/>
<h5>
    4. You will need to make hard choices in life, even if it makes your eyes
    bleed.
</h5>
<p>
    Doing the right thing, sometimes, can be like running up a steep mountain
    in biting wintry air in the indigo dark of dawn. Uncomfortable, and you
    really REALLY do not want to do it. You would rather stay warm in your bed,
    tucking your blanket around your toes. And yet, you may need to steel your
    heart and get that run in. In life, such resolve is what will make you
    great at what you do. When Diana makes her tough choice in the movie, we
    see her heart collapse in her chest. But she walks away resolved to move on
    and face her next steps. That resolve, my friends, is a superpower.

    5. It is better to live in a disappointing truth than a pleasing delusion.
</h5>

<p>
    In Matrix, Neo is offered a choice between a Red Pill and a Blue Pill. The
    Red Pill will cause him to face a reality that is unpleasant, and the Blue
    Pill will let him be live swimmingly in a blissful make-believe world. Neo
    chooses the Red Pill. The Truth. Likewise, the Wonder Woman in WW84 urges
    us to choose Truth. The mirages of wealth, power, fame, and so on can be
    irresistible, but Truth is what will save your humanity, the movie argues.
    What is the truth of your life? What is your authentic true self? Who do
    you want to be? These are all wonderful questions for us to answer as
    professionals.
</p>

<br/>
<br/>
<p>
    I loved WW84 for all these lessons. Unlike other superhero movies, it made
    me reflect on work and life. Unlike other superhero movies, too, the hero
    doesn't just beat up people because she can. She uses carefully
    distinguishes innocent people from bad ones, and avoids punishes the
    innocent. Such thoughtfulness in the middle of crisis is something every
    leader needs to show.
</p>
<p>
    I know the reviews for the movie has been largely atrocious. But,
    personally, I believe I have found a new Christmas tradition.
