    On a trip back to India two years ago, I struck up a conversation with 
    the helper in my family's home, Jayanthi. Jayanthi is from one of the oppressed castes in India. She had been working in other people's homes,
    sweeping floors, washing clothes, and scrubbing dishes, ever since she was a teenager. That 
    had been her 'family profession'. Her
    husband had vanished from her life, leaving her with her two young daughters. 
</p>
<p>
    One blistering afternoon, as an enormous ceiling fan was whirling over our
    heads, I asked Jayanthi if her daughters went to school. Would she send them to college some day? 
    I asked, hoping for an affirmative and fearing the opposite.
</p>
<p>
    "No, ma," she said, "What are they going to do with
    school?"
</p>
<p>
    "Wouldn't you like to see them in an office job?" I asked.
</p>
<p>
    "No, that's never going to happen," she shook her head and dismissed the
    notion as though it were as laughable as a unicorn in the middle of our living
    room.
</p>
<p>
    Later that night, as I lay on fresh-smelling sheets, I reflected on our chat. I valued education above most
    things in life. That's partly because I had the advantage of a father who 
    believed in education. He himself had grown up in a
    family filled with scholars: one of his grandfathers was a local
    magistrate, and the other was a doctor. Our family had been steeped in
    education for generations. I had personally seen how education can elevate a person's life. 
</p>
<p>
Jayanthi did not 
have the same schemas in her head that equated  
learning to empowerment and
    progress. Her options, dreams, and prospects were  
circumscribed by the norms for her caste and class. I had seen 
many people like Jayanthi, people stuck in their situations 
because of biases and beliefs. Jayanthi and I lived worlds apart, even though 
we inhabited the same space under that ceiling fan. Unless something drastic 
changed, her family would likely never catch up to mine in their quality of life. Our gap could even, sadly,  
widen over time.
</p>
<p>
    This little encounter came into my head recently when I read a book about the use for of
    data in mass decision-making systems and how that results in greater
    inequality in our society. The book is called "Weapons of Math
    Destruction", written by Cathy O'Neil.

<br/><br/>
  <p>
  In modern
    times, mass decision-making algorithms decide many aspects of our lives. 
      They decide
    who gets a loan, who goes to top schools, who gets locked up in a prison, who
    is hired for jobs, and so on. They can bring greater fortune or greater ruin to individuals. 
</p>
<p>They often use <em>heuristics (</em>aka
    'rules of thumb') to make such judgements. These heuristics are coded in or
    learned from data by the machine. They are usually based on the
    belief that <em>the</em> <em>past can predict the future</em>. 
</p>
<p>
    There are three problems with the use of such heuristics in our algorithms.
</p>
<p>
    <ol>

        <li>
   Their conclusions are probabilistic in nature. They may say, for example, 
that Jayanthi will __probably__ not
 pay back a loan, if she 
had defaulted before. But people and their circumstances 
change. Without heed to that fact, 
if this conclusion is 
applied with a scalpel's precision on a human, 
they result in 
<b>vicious cycles that one can never get 
out of.</b> 
        <li>
    It is not just you, the individual, on whom the bright gaze of these
    algorithms falls. The algorithms try to predict your behavior based on
            behavior of people <b>'like you'</b> and their past too. People from the same race as you, the same
    zip code as you, the same economic stratum as you.

</p>
<p>
In human brain, such 
pattern matching is not new and not wholly
    pernicious. It helped our ancestors survive in the Savannahs. Our IQ tests
    judge us as intelligent if we can group similar objects based on abstract
    patterns. But it can often lead us astray. It
    leads us to believe that a woman who has neatly styled hair, wearing bold
    lipstick and six-inch heels, does not fit the mold of a scientist. It can
    cause juries to pre-judge a black man guilty. It can cause school
    admissions officials to judge Jayanthi's daughter, living in her rickety
    shack in a squalid slum with illiterate parents, to be less likely to
succeed in their schools.    <strong>These are dangerous biases and stereotypes in our heads</strong>.
    Many of us will steer away from them if they become aware of them. But
    when they come sheathed in the sophistication, the supposed objectiveness, and the opaqueness of our algorithms, we
    simply accept them as truths.
</li>
<li>
    These mass data systems <strong>miss the trees for the forest</strong>.
    Look at the image below. 

<br/><br/>

If I asked you what this image is, you 
    might say that it is drawing of a group of snowmen. You might be right in the 'big
    picture', but you also missed the lone panda lurking in there. (If you
    can't see her, I will give you a hint at the end of this article.) In the
    forest of snowmen, most people miss the panda. But the panda exists and
    needs to be fed. 

</p>
<p>

Our data systems miss the lone pandas too. Often our data
    systems make decisions from aggregate wholes and miss the nuances of
    individuals in the group. For example, if you made a decision about the need of bamboo
    sticks using the average of this picture, most likely the panda
    would not get her bamboo. That - indeed - would be sad.
        </li></ol>
</p>
<p>
    The truth is that what applies to the sum may not apply to the constituent
    parts. Our mass data systems, however, ignore that. They aggregate data and
    present conclusions that human decision-makers then turn around and apply
    to individuals. It becomes more damaging when these algorithms are used
    over large numbers of heterogenous people, do not use feedback loops to
    correct their mistaken inferences, and act as black boxes whose conclusions
    cannot be taken apart with reasoning.
</p>
<p>
    I live and breath data in my work. I have built multiple software systems
    that use intelligence to aid human decision-making. I am not against the
    use of data, far from it. In our modern lives, data helps us avoid
    congested roads when we drive. It prods us to pack an extra sweater for our
    trip abroad. It helps us understand what parts of the products we build are
    helping our customers, and what parts are not. It tells me that I
    should try Yuval Noah Harari's book next, because I have liked similar
    books in the past and my friends have liked his writing. Modern data
    systems have come to understand us as well as, or even better than, our
    dearest friends.
</p>
<p>
    But Cathy O'Neil is right. Our data systems can make mistakes. And when
    they make mistakes at massive scales, the result may be as innocuous as a few
    drenched and unhappy humans who didn't take an umbrella with them when it rained. But it may
    also result in the erosion of our democracy, the widening of inequality, and the
    destruction of justice.
</p>
<p>
    Human societies have been riddled with inequality since pre-historic times.
    Jayanthi's station in life comes from centuries of oppression of some 
    humans by others. But the arc of history has been bending relentlessly toward
    justice. As we build our future, as we architect a world driven more and
    more by math, let us not reverse that. Let's be cognizant of biases in data. With great power
    comes great responsibility. Data and math are insanely powerful. Let us
    wield them responsibly. Let's build trust in our systems with transparency, feedback loops, and diversity in the process of training and creating them.

    I enjoyed reading the book
    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B019B6VCLO">
        Weapons of Math Destruction.
    </a>
     It was thought-provoking, much needed in these times reverberating with voices of unity as well as with voices of division.
