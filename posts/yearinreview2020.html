    As 2020 dawned, I made a list of things I wanted to do this year.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Travel more
    </li>
    <li>
        Write more
    </li>
    <li>
        Read more
    </li>
    <li>
        Watch less TV
    </li>
    <li>
        Strength-train more at the gym
    </li>
    <li>
        &#8230;and so on.
    </li>
</ul>
<p> 
    No surprise, but only a few of those came true. 
    It was a case of the best laid plans gone awry. 
    I did write more and read
    more. But traveling came to a screeching halt. There was little if any gym.
    And boy oh boy, did I binge-watch TV! All those episodes of The Crown and
    Unorthodox and The Vikings and many, many late-night comedy shows were rivers of grain for my
    grindstone.
</p>
<br/>
<h5>
    2020 has been a year like no other in my recent memory.
</h5>
<p>
    I remember the day when I first had the hunch that this year might be 
    different. It was in early March, a cool, overcast day in Seattle. There was a sharp smell of 
fresh cut grass in the air. As I walked
    to my car at the end of my workday, I looked at my phone, and there it
    was, at the top of my unread email - a message from our one of our VPs
    telling us to work from home until end of the month. All travel was
    suspended. My heart sank. I had a few trips and events I was looking forward to,
    including a keynote at a Codess event and a visit to Lagos to see my team. I
    comforted myself that things would surely change soon, hopefully in April.
</p>
<p>
    April came and went. Dense morning fogs gave way to watercolor blue skies.
    I continued to work hard to find answers to the new questions of our new
    reality. Should I work with my laptop, perched on my sofa, or should I pony
    up the money for a proper office setup? How do I deal with my now-constant
    neck pain? Should I turn on the camera when my home was a mess, and my hair
    was an even bigger mess? How do I structure my now amorphous days? Whose turn was it to cook lunch? Why was there so much dust on our tables? 
    Why were there so many dishes in the sink?
    Should I buy more canned beans and soap? Should I be sanitizing
    the many cardboard boxes that got delivered from Amazon? Do I still fit
    into my jeans? How can I help my team feel connected and energized, when
    all around them was hardship, chaos, and unknowns? How can I make sure my
    75-year-old dad and my 81-year-old mother-in-law were safe and cared for?
    What happens if one of them falls sick and I can't travel?
</p>

<br/>
<h5>
    Slowly though, things started to fall into place.
</h5>

<p>
    I started feeling less anxious. I created new routines for myself. I
    started running in the morning, meditating in the evening, bookending my
    workdays. I started clearing dishes in the sink after work, listening
    to audiobooks. I checked in with my team regularly. I started talking to
    our parents every day instead of just the weekends. These new habits and
    routines began to help.
</p>
<p>
    Of course, there were still 
    unimaginable losses and tragedies happening every day around the globe. No measure 
    of habits and rituals can change that. 
    But I started
    feeling less anguished about our new reality on a daily basis. I even began to appreciate the
    blessings it bestowed on me. 
</p>
<p> 
Working from home, I missed seeing my team. But I didn't have to spend quite so much time in
    traffic, enduring bad drivers. I didn't have to attend Happy
    Hours where I pretended to enjoy the conversations when all I wanted to do
    was go home, get into my pajamas, listen to nothing but the low hum of my fridge, 
    and lose myself in a good book. I had so much
    more time for connecting with my family, with my husband. I had so much
    more time for my books.
</p>
<p>
    Speaking of books, I read a TON.

<h5>
    By far, the best book I read this year was Becoming by Michelle Obama.
</h5>
<p>
    Becoming is the story of Michelle Obama's growing up and her years in the
    White House. In it, we see Michelle as a flesh-and-blood human being - with her flaws, her anxieties, her strengths,  her dreams, and her disappointments. 
    She is not just
    a made-up character in her flowing gowns and her J. Crew dresses, alternately
    glorified and vilified by the
    media. In this book, she comes across as someone who has worked hard for
    her accomplishments, as someone who wants to make a difference in the
    world. I loved reading about her "box-checking", accomplishment-craving,
    perfectionist tendencies - tendencies I battle with in myself.
</p>
<p>
    Here is a quote that I underlined in my copy of Becoming that REALLY speaks
    to me.
</p>
<br/>
<p>    
    <div align="center" style="border-style:double;border-color:black;padding:10px">
        <blockquote>
    It wasn't pretty, but I found it encouraging in the end, proof that I could
    work my way out of just about any hole. Whatever deficits I might have
    arrived with, coming from an inner-city high school, it seemed that I could
    make up for them by putting in extra time, asking for help when I needed
    it, and learning to pace myself and not procrastinate.
        </blockquote>

</p>
<br/>
<p>
    I later read her husband's new book "A Promised Land". While Barack Obama's new book is more 
    expansive - a telling of grand history where you learn about how world leaders make big decisions and 
    navigate national politics - the writing is sadly not as crisp as Michelle's. Michelle Obama is not just our 
    former first lady, but she is indeed a skilled writer. Her writing in Becoming, is intimate,
    vivid, honest, clear, and enjoyable. It feels like a thick coat of melted butter on
    a piece of toast. Smooth, delicious, and decadent. 
</p>
<p>
    I know some of you will be taking time off work this month. Holidays are a
    time to reflect and recharge. What better way to recharge than with a good
    book? And if there is just one book you can read from now until the end of
    the year, I recommend Becoming by Michelle Obama. I hope you enjoy it.
</p>
<p>
<h5>Happy Holidays, folks!</h5>
