    <div className="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">If you've been working for some time, you might have wondered
        occasionally if it was time to change jobs. If you are early in your career, you can bet that this is a decision
        you will need to make in your life. A lot of my mentoring conversations revolve around this particular personal
        question for my mentees.<br /><br /><em>Should I look for a new team/job given my
            circumstances?</em><br /><br />As I have tried to help people answer that question for themselves, I have
        touched upon a few things I have learned myself about good decision-making. </div>

            <font size="6">Most decisions we make in our lives do not require a lot of thought</font>
        </strong><br /><br /><em>&#8203;Do I want to eat chocolate ice cream or tiramisu cake for
            dessert?</em><br /><br /><em>Do I wear a bright print dress or denim and t-shirt?</em><br /><br /><em>Do I
            want to read fiction or non-fiction next?</em><br /><br /><em>Do I *really* want to floss
            today?</em><br /><br />These are decisions that require very little cognitive skill and cycles. They are
        simple and generally not costly. We make them mostly by how we feel, and it is best not to waste a lot of energy
        on these pedestrian decisions. People have suggested creating systems and habits in place to aid in making them
        quickly (e.g.: always pick the piece of clothing closest to you to wear, alternate fiction and non-fiction,
        always floss after you brush etc.).<br /><span style="color:rgb(37, 37, 37)"><br /><strong>
                <font size="6">There are other decisions that require deep thinking</font>
            </strong><br /></span>There are some decisions we make in life - like the question I started this post with
        about making a job change - that require thought. We make such decisions many times in our lives, so it is best
        to understand some tools/tips to make them well. Here are my three tips:<br />&#8203;</div>
    <div className="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><strong>
            <font size="5">1- Choose your decision-making framework</font>
        </strong><br />Every complex decision you make is of a different class, so your first order of business is to
        choose the right framework for your question at hand. This is indeed half the battle, so do spend some time on
        it. There are many famous decision-making tools you can choose from: simple "pros vs. cons" lists, <a

            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_matrix" target="_blank">decision matrices</a> and so on. One of
        these might be the tool most applicable to your problem. You might also come up with something on your own, or
        you might want to simply "sleep on your decision". As basic as it sounds, <a
            href="https://www.ted.com/talks/matt_walker_sleep_is_your_superpower?language=en" target="_blank">sleeping
            has been proven</a> to recruit creativity and breakthrough thinking. It is an underrated yet highly valuable
        tool to aid decision making.<br /><br />To illustrate, let's get back to the original question about changing
        jobs. Personally, I have changed teams/jobs multiple times in my life, and I have organically created a
        framework that I turn to for this purpose every time.<ul>
            <li>First, reflect on what are the most important things that keep you in a team. For me, after much
                reflection, I know these are: the people I work with, how much learning I am doing on the job, how much
                impact am I having, and how my career is progressing on the team.</li>
            <li>Spend a TON of time reflecting on the job and how it is evaluating against these important things.</li>
        </ul> And that's it. It is not a mathematical formula that will magically give you an answer. The key is to let
        your brain reflect on the problem at hand, deeply and in ways that can aid your
        decision-making.<br /><br /><strong>
            <font size="5">2- Do not ignore intuition</font>
        </strong><br />As a person who makes products centered on data-driven decision making, it might seem strange
        coming from me: listen to your instinct. Don't get me wrong - I tend to use data in making most of my decisions,
        but especially in areas where I have gained a lot of experience, I don't ignore intuition. &#8203;<br />&#8203;

            <font size="4">For what is intuition? It is a set of mnemonics your brain has stored away from years of
                learning - a lot of it subconscious - and it is important to not undervalue that learning.</font>
        </span></div>
    <div className="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><br />&#8203;Malcolm Gladwell opens his famous book <a
            href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FOR9ZHS/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1"
            target="_blank">Blink: the power of thinking without thinking</a> with the story of kouros, an ancient Greek
        statue that the Getty Museum was evaluating for a purchase. The asking price for the statue was $10 million.
        Every background analysis on the statue checked out, and the piece was purchased. However, an art historian who
        later viewed the statue was struck by its inauthenticity. The same sense of "something is not right" was felt by
        a couple more art experts that viewed it. After a few more investigations, it was concluded that the kouros was
        in fact not genuine.<br /><br />The moral of the story is that what weeks of initial investigations could not
        find was ferreted out intuitively by experts. This is because the experts were able to instantly access a lot of
        subconscious information in their heads collected over years of learning. It is advisable to not ignore what
        that trove of information points to.<br /><br />&#8203;That said, while intuition is fast, <a
            href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/10/30/daniel-kahneman-intuition/" target="_blank">it can be
            flawed</a> too, so sift what it points to for inherent biases.<br /><br /><strong>
            <font size="5">3- Assume most decisions are reversible</font>
        </strong><br />Most decisions we make in life do not indenture us to them. We can go back and make a different
        choice, the only loss in most cases being time/money. When you weigh the loss of time/money against the
        opportunity in front of you, it is likely you come out ahead by making a decision sooner than later. Most of the
        time, which way you go is less important than what you do down the line.&#8203;</div>
    <div className="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><br />&#8203;So pick a path, decide on the checkpoints where you
        want to evaluate how you're doing, have a strategy to roll back or course correct if things are not going as
        well as you expected. Then make the decision and go on your merry way.<br /><br />Prominent behavioral
        scientist<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Kahneman" target="_blank"> Daniel Kahneman</a> says it is
        best to judge &#8203;&#8203;the quality of your decisions not based on how they turned out. If you do that, you
        fall victim to what is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outcome_bias" target="_blank">outcome
            bias</a>.<br />&#8203;</div>

            <font size="4">Judge the quality of your decisions on the process you used to make them.</font>
        </span></div><br />
    <div className="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Use a sound and logical process to make important decisions in
        your life. Act, monitor, evaluate, repeat. That's the best you can do.</div>
