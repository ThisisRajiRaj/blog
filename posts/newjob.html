        I have a job that I like, but I have this new job offer/role that
        sounds pretty tempting. Should I accept it and move? And, if I do, what
        do I do in my first days on the new team?
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Have you pondered questions like these? I hear them often in my conversations
    with friends and mentees. I have mulled them over myself at times.
</p>
<p>
    My father worked in the same bank for thirty years. My mother-in-law taught
    at the same school for over two decades. But these days, with so many
    opportunities in front of us, the question of change is ever-present. While
    I have worked in just two companies over the course of my 18-year career, I
    have changed roles and teams many times. How do you make good decisions
    about such changes, and how do you start right in your new job?
</p>
<p>
    Let's begin with the first question.
</p>
<br/>
<h4>
    Should I accept a new job/role and move away from work I like?
</h4>
<p>
If you hate your current job, it's a no-brainer.    <strong>Move if you think that the new job is going to be better.</strong>
    Life it too fleeting for you to stay in unhappy or toxic situations. But it
    can be hard to tell if a new job is going to be better that the current
    one. There are no guarantees, of course, but you can get a sense by talking
    to the hiring manager, researching online, interviewing people currently on
    the team and so on. In any case, your decision-making is generally easier
    if your current job is not a great one.
</p>
<p>
    But let us say your current job doesn't suck. Then what do you do?
    <a href="https://www.rajiraj.com/blog/decisions-decisions-decisions">
        I wrote about this topic in another post
    </a>
    some time ago. For most decisions like this one, you use two different ways
    of discernment. The most obvious one, the one that comes naturally to those
    of us trained in critical thinking, is <strong>deliberation</strong>. I.e.,
    we think. We analyze. We list pros and cons. We use decision-making
frameworks. The less obvious and more ignored way of discernment is to    <strong>use the emotional fabric in your mind and your intuition</strong>.
    Asking yourself how you feel about a certain situation. As you evaluate the
    question of a new role, use both these ways to make your decision.
</p>
<p>
    When I deliberate on this question myself, for example, I consider a few
    things:
</p>
<p>
    1. What is the pull in the new job? Is it money, is it an opportunity to
    learn something new, or is it make something wonderful?
</p>
<p>
    2. What does success mean to me in the job? This could include taking a
    product public, turning around a team, building a new platform, or learning
    some transferable skill. But it would also include my own happiness and
    growth.
</p>
<p>
    3. How would I rate this job on the things I care about in work in general?
    For me, it is important to work with great people, in a culture that aligns
    with my values, to make a difference to others with my work, have autonomy
    on the job, and learn new things constantly.
</p>
<p>
    4. Can I see any obvious issue with the role? What are the disadvantages I
    can list?
</p>
<p>
    5. What is my plan if I fail in the job? And what does failure mean? It is
    good to spend a few minutes thinking about this question and the last one.
    The goal is not to get discouraged from making the change because there are
    some cons and possibilities of failure. The opportunity might just be so
    exciting that I want to go for it despite all that. But I can use these
    insights to negotiate my offer better and/or to shape my plan for my first
    days in the new role.
</p>
<p>
    So now let's look at the next question.
</p>

<br/>
<h4>
    How can you do a great job in the first days at the job?
</h4>

    As you start your new job, think about what your strengths are and how you
    can lean on them to bring value to your team. Reflect on why you were
    hired. Was it your tech skills, your ability to grow ideas, your
    professional network, or something else? Make sure you have a plan to
    leverage them in your job.
</p>
<p>
    Make a list of things you want to accomplish in your first hundred days.
    Why hundred days? World leaders frequently get reviewed on their first
    hundred days in office, and this is a great timeframe for your work as
    well. Three months plus a few days give you enough time to
    <strong>
        expand your knowledge, learn about the culture, increase your network,
        get some early wins, and establish long term goals.
    </strong>
    As you prepare for your first hundred days, plan your learning. Think
    about where you can bring quick wins to establish your credibility. Make it
    a priority to talk to people on the team. Be curious about the business and
    the technology. Be curious about the humans around you and their stories.
    Try to connect with them and understand what they do, what they enjoy, and
    what their challenges are. Doing this will help you learn more, but also
    build relationships around you.
</p>
<p>
    Someone recently asked me if I thought first impressions at a new job are
    important. Indeed, I believe first impressions are important, whether you
    are making a business deal or interviewing for a job or you are in a new
    job. People will update their mental models as they get to know you and
    (hopefully) not rely solely on first impressions, but you want to start off
    on the right foot.
    <strong>
        The best way to do that is to add value and to be genuine, curious, and
        empathetic with people around you.
    </strong>
    If you are looking for books you can read while starting a new job, here are a couple of recommendations.

    Changes - in life and at work - are equal parts exciting and challenging.
    Having a plan to navigate through them, while understanding that no plan
    will be perfect - and that's ok, you'll adapt - is vital. If you are
    planning a change in your work, I hope you found something of value in this
    post. And I wish you good luck.
