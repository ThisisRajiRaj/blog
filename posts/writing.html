    I grew up with a father that wrote every day. He would wake up at 5AM, the
    dark of the night still pressing on us, and frogs in the wasteland
    next to our flat croaking loudly. 
</p>
<p>
    My father would sit cross-legged like a <em>yogi</em> in our living room,
    place a 4'x6' teak plank across his lap, open his notebook, uncap his Hero
    pen, and write. From my room, I would hear the scratch of his fountain pen
    on paper, my grandma snoring in her bed, and the frogs croaking away. My
    dad wrote many things: poems, essays, short stories, and op-ed pieces for
    local newspapers. Most of what he wrote, however, no one read. They would
    lay without a whisper between the lined pages of his bound notebook. This
    didn't matter to him. He wrote because he HAD to write. He sent some of his
    creations to magazines and newspapers. Some he would read to me on warm
    evenings under moonlight and ask for feedback.
</p>
<p>
    I was no stranger to  writing when growing up. From
    a very young age, I wanted to write. From a very young age, I had a love
    for words and books.
</p>
<p>
    Books became my BFFs after I immigrated to Canada. The local library in Richmond, Canada, 
    was a find that gave me as much
    pleasure as a poor farmer might feel after finding a chest full of
    gold buried in his land. When I learned that I could borrow up to
    twenty-five books at once, and could keep them all for a month at a time, I
    practically jumped up and down. I started my weekly pilgrimage to the
    library in Richmond. The roads on my
    route were lined with cherry-blossom trees heavy with pink flowers in the
    spring, and stark branches laden with snow in the winter.
</p>
<p>
    I read a lot in the years I lived in Canada: everything from Virginia Woolf
    to Richard Dawkins to Vikram Seth to Natalie Goldberg to Douglas Adams. I
    started writing frequently for local magazines, just like my father had
    done back home. Writing, I realized was a pleasant activity, but getting my
    writing published was HARD WORK! I wrote first drafts, and then reviewed
    and revised and reviewed and revised multiple times. I spent hours on a
    1000-word essay that a magazine would ultimately pay me a $100 for. I was
    not going to make a living as a writer, I decided. I read a lot of books on
    writing, wrote every day, and continued to strive to become a good writer.
    My academic writing got a vigorous shine when I submitted by dissertation
    to my advisor. Every line in my thesis was analyzed, the veracity and the
    logic of it questioned. The first draft of my thesis was returned with so
    many red markings in it that the pages felt like a murder scene.

<h4>
    Why I write (and why you should too)
</h4>

    I now write every day. Obviously, my early years with a writer
    father had an influence. But I have come to appreciate writing for its
    multiple benefits to my work and life:
</p>
<p>
    1- <strong>Writing clearly helps you think clearly</strong>. You refine
    your logic and your arguments by seeing them spelt out on paper.
</p>
<p>
    2- 
    <strong>Communicating ideas has become as critical to work in the information
        age as using arrows would have been to our ancestors. 
    </strong>
    Writing helps you organize your ideas to communicate them better.
</p>
<p>
    3- <strong>Writing helps you sharpen your focus</strong>. When you sit down
    to write, and face the tyranny of the blank page, you have no choice but to
    focus. With practice, this focus gets stronger and transferrable to other
    areas of your life.
</p>
<p>
    4-
    <strong>
        Writing is a channel for the dammed river of creativity inside you. 
    </strong>
    Humans are driven to create. Whether we create a delicious meal for our
    family, or the Sistine Chapel, the drive to create and the joy of creating
    is integral to human experience. Writing is an accessible outlet for that
    creativity.
</p>
<p>
    5- <strong>Writing helps you conquer your fear of rejection. </strong>Over
    my years of professional experience, I have learned that many of us battle
    with a fear of rejection so strong it threatens to eat us alive. Every time
    you write something to be read by others, you put yourself out there for
    critique and rejection. But by doing so, you learn to deal with the inner
    talk that tries to stop you because it doesn't want you to be rejected. You
    learn to quiet it to mere hiss you can then ignore in other activities in
    your life too.
</p>
<p>
    6-
    <strong>
        Writing helps you share your experiences and the knowledge gained from
        them. 
    </strong>
    Language evolved not just so our ancestors can collaborate and kill a
    mammoth. Language helped us shares our experiences with each other. This
    sharing helped us learn, entertain, and influence action. All things you
    can do with writing.
</p>
<p>
7- There is a philosophical school of thought that consciousness is really <em>self-consciousness.</em> I.e., you notice yourself as a being because
    others notice you as a being. Whether you agree with this philosophy or
    not, there is almost a primal need we have
    <strong>
        to be heard, to matter to others, to leave behind something of
        yourself.
    </strong>
    Writing helps you do that.

    I recommend that you try your hand at writing too.
</h4>

<p>
    You don't need to get a degree in English to get started. Writing classes
    and workshops can help but are not necessary. You don't need to comb
    through the shelves of a library to research a topic.
</p>
<p>
    You can start with yourself and your lived experience.
</p>
<p>
    You can write about what you're most familiar with. But as you write, try
    to delve deeper into your experience. Swim in the emotional waters of it.
    Try to look at it multiple perspectives and get to the nugget of truth that
    is not obvious. Think: what is it that you want your reader to take away
    after they give you their precious attention? Are you trying to persuade
    them to do something? Are you trying to teach? Are you trying to just let
    them see the world from different lens? Make your point clearly and as
    powerfully as you can.
</p>
<p>
    But all of this will not happen right away. When you start writing, you may
    find yourselves well and truly stuck. How do you unstick yourself? Anne
    Lammott, a writing coach, sets out two important activities for writers in
    her seminal book "Bird by Bird".
</p>
<p>
    - <strong>Writing "Shitty First Drafts"</strong>. Your first draft should
    be to just get your thoughts on the page. For your second draft, you can do
    surgery on your first draft and get the piece to do what you want it to do.
    Your final draft is about fixing up minor things to really make it
    shipshape.
</p>
<p>
    - <strong>Doing short writing assignments</strong>. I often come to my
    writing space, power up the computer, open Word, and stare. I don't know to
    what to write or where to begin. To get out of this, I tell myself that my
    job is to just write one short paragraph. Just a description of my father
    as he sat writing in our flat all those years ago. That's it.
</p>
<p>
    These two tools have helped me a great deal. In addition, I use "outlining"
    to help me plan the structure of my work ahead of time. Of course, after I
    start writing, I let the flow take me in directions I hadn't planned, but I
    find it good to have some guardrails and mileposts.
</p>
<p>
    Once you have written your third and final draft, you are now ready to
    publish it. Publishing it so you can feedback from people is easier now
    than ever with blogging. Find your favorite Blogging provider (Wordpress,
    Weebly, Blogger, …), and hit Publish! Now forget about the post and move on
    to your next story. Your job is to just get your work out there, not to
    worry about how it is received.

    I am sincere when I say developing a habit of writing will help you in many
    ways, most importantly in your work. Even if you are in tech, write more
    often. It will help you become a better communicator, which will give you a
    leg up in your career. You want to learn more? Here are some books that can
    help.

    I hope you come to enjoy writing for its own sake as I do, but also for the
    benefits it offers your work and life. See you on your own blogging site!
