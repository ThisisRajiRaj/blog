        <div className="paragraph" style="display:block;"><br>Today many Tamil people around the world celebrate a
            festival called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhogi" target="_blank">Bhogi</a>. We set aside a day
            - the day before our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pongal_(festival)" target="_blank">harvest
                festival</a>&nbsp;- to ritualistically let go of things that are not working in our lives.<br><br>I am
            not one for religious rituals in general, but this one strikes a chord. To set aside a day to reflect on
            what you want in your life...but more importantly,&nbsp;what you want out. Old furniture, clothes that have
            lost their luster, used books, broken tools. Relationships that are not working. Habits that do not help.
            Beliefs that are binding you. The clutter in your life. I find it awesome that we set aside a day
            specifically to inventory them and ritualistically get them out of our lives.<br><br></div>

        <div className="paragraph"><br><span style="color:rgb(37, 37, 37)">&#8203;On the day of Bhogi, houses are
                scrubbed clean, whitewashed, and mopped from corner to corner. As the day dawns, we make huge bonfires
                in our neighborhoods. Residents come out of their houses, most in their night clothes and bed hair,
                bearing material things they want to get rid of. We stand around the fire, gossiping, reflecting, and
                cathartically letting go of the undesired old so we make space for the desired new. The belief is that
                the universe doesn’t send you new things, new people, habits, and experiences if your life is still
                clogged with the detritus of the past. So get rid of the old - the saying goes - and welcome the new
                into your life!<br><br>Of course, there is no Indian festival without special food items. For Bhogi, we
                make crispy deep-fried lentil cakes called <em>vadai</em>, warm crepes stuffed with sweetened coconut
                flakes and cardomom called <em>poli</em>, and a version of <em>payasam </em>- a sweet pudding made with
                milk and ghee from a recipe dating 8th century AD.</span><br><br><br></div>

        <div className="paragraph"><br>Bhogi is a day of midwinter cleaning of sorts. It is a time of reflection and
            accounting of the habits, activities, things, and people you want less of in your life.<br><br>This year, as
            I reflect on what I want less of in my life, the following are some items that bubble up to the top. I
            want:<br><br>
            <ol style="color:rgb(37, 37, 37)">
                <li>Less mindless TV</li>
                <li>No Reddit. Yes, I said it. But I need to sacrifice ONE of my time sinks this year</li>
                <li>Less beating myself up for mistakes and imperfections</li>
                <li>Less being a prisoner to the clock</li>
            </ol><br>So off into the Bhogi bonfire they go.&nbsp;<br><br><span style="color:rgb(37, 37, 37)">We think a
                lot about what we want <strong>more of </strong>in our lives. My friend wants that pretty red handbag.
                Another wants to get a PhD. I want to write and publish books. Many want to have more successes in their
                career. I want, you want, they want. What are you willing to do less of so you get more of what you
                want? You need to create space so these new things you want can take root in your life. Reflect on that
                today, and write your own "less of" list. Then symbolically toss it into the Bhogi
                bonfire.<br><br>&#8203;Happy Bhogi!</span><br><span style="color:rgb(37, 37, 37)">&#8203;&#8203;</span>
