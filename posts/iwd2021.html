<p>
    Let's start with my mother.
    <br/>
</p>
<p>
    My mother didn't live long - she died when she was thirty-two - but she was
    remarkable when she was alive. She had liquid brown eyes that were shaped
    like large almonds. With her small nose, and her narrow jaw, she was a
    stunning woman. My father had fallen in love with her before he married
    her, something that was unusual in Indian marriages of their time. My
    mother was not highly educated though. She finished high school, but after
    she graduated, her family decided to stop her education. That was in
    keeping with her time.
</p>
<p>
    Women didn't used to get educated beyond high school in my mother's era. It
    was a rare woman that had a college degree, and a rarer one with a career.
    People thought that educating a woman meant trouble. She could become too
    dominant in the family, could develop strong opinions. A good bride was a
    quiet, malleable, and an ignorant one. My mother was smart, there was no
    doubt about it. But she didn't have the privilege to be educated beyond
    twelfth grade. The norms just would not have it.
</p>
<p>
    After she married my dad, and my brother was on his way into the world, she
    realized that she would have to work. My father had an entry-level job at a
    national bank, and soon - they figured - the family income would not be
    enough. So, she found herself a job on a factory floor, boxing automobile
    parts. But that was not a career; it was a way to bring some extra cash
    into the household. When my father got a better-paying job, my mother
    simply quit. After a few years, I was born, and my mother never got paid
    for her work again.
</p>
<p>
    It was worse for my mother's mother. My grandma was born in a tiny village
    called Ganapathi Agraharam, famous for its breezy rice fields. She was
    sharp as a scythe. If she had been born in more modern times, she would
    have gone on to have college education and done insanely cool things. In
    her time, though, she was expected to stop school when she started
    menstruating. My grandma got her first periods when she was in eighth
    grade. The family conferred on what to do. The girl - my grandma - was just
    too smart. Even for those backward times, it was unconscionable to stop her
    education that early. My grandma's mother suggested that they keep her
    periods a secret, and have my grandma continue school. She did. She would
    not attend school whenever she had her periods - they believed a
    menstruating woman was impure and had to be quarantined - but she continued
    school until she graduated tenth grade.
</p>
<p>
    Amidst all the women in my family, who had great potential but indelible
    societal boundaries limiting them, there was my aunt Sundari, my father's
    brother's wife. Aunt Sundari was the only woman I knew, as I was growing
    up, that had a job even though she didn't have to. Not just a job, a career
    that she enjoyed. Aunt Sundari is a big reason for my resolve to have a
    career and my pursuit of economic independence.
</p>
<p>
    Aunt Sundari lived in Delhi with her husband and their son. Every time, she
    visited us in Chennai, we would have memorably long conversations. A lot of
    these conversations were mundane, but many yielded wisdom that I would
    cherish to this day.
</p>
<p>
    One day, as aunt Sundari and I were leaning over the parapet of our open
    terrace, letting the salty air from the Bay of Bengal cool us, we talked
    about her job. As a teenager thinking a lot about my future, I wanted to
    know all about working, especially as a woman. I had heard stories about my
    aunt's miserable commute in Delhi. She had to travel in a public bus, with
    men and women packed like the pulp of an orange. She almost never found a
    seat and had to stand for the entire length of her journey. "Is it tough?"
    I asked her. Didn't she feel tired at the end of the day, coming home and
    still having to cook dinner for her family? Was it frightening to work with
    so many men around her?
</p>
<p>
    Peppered with questions, Aunt Sundari looked at me for a long minute and
    nodded.
</p>
<p>
    "Yes, it is tough," she said.
</p>
<p>
    "Then why do you work?"
</p>
<p>
    "Because Raji," she said, with a serious look on her face, "when you want
    to buy something as simple as a tube of lipstick, you should not have to
    stand in front of your husband for permission or money."
</p>
<p>
    It took a bit of time for me to register what she had just said. But then I
    felt a little candleflame ignite inside my head. Aunt Sundari worked
    because her work gave her freedom. It asserted her standing within her
    family. It allowed her to buy things for herself, without the need for
    anyone else's approval. It made her feel empowered. It may have been the
    precise moment that I became determined to find a profession and pursue a
    career. If I ever wanted to buy a tube of red lipstick, frivolous as it
    might be, I wanted the wherewithal to buy it. Not just a candleflame, but a
    fire was lit inside me. Now, I do believe that everyone should make their
    own choice on how they want to live their lives. Being a homemaker and
    caring for children is important - if unpaid - work. That said, it pains me
    every time I see a woman choose to lean out either because the corporate
    norms do not work for her or because there is no equal partnership at home
    or because she has simply not thought it through.
</p>
<p>
    In my view, work - a career - is more than just a way to make a living.
    Work can make you confident in yourself. It can open up new horizons, new
    experiences, new worldviews that might have been previously inaccessible.
    Work can give you purpose. It can help you develop new meaningful social
    connections. It can fill you with joy as you contribute to the success of
    others and feel proud of your own accomplishments. On top of all of that,
    work gives you economic power and financial independence. These are
    important elements as we seek equality for women.
</p>
<p>
    Today is celebrated as the International Women's Day. When I reflect on the
    generations of women before us, I realize how far we have come. Women in
    the past weren't educated well or allowed in the workplace. Over time,
    through many struggles, we won the right to work and earn our financial
    freedom. With every generation that passed, we became more educated, more
    powerful at the workplace. We still have ways to go toward equality at home
    and at work. Let's continue our push for it.
</p>
<p>
    Happy International Women's Day, everyone!
