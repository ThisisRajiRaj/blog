There is an exception, however: I know what statement is wrong, but not necessarily what statement is correct. If I see a black swan I can certify that all swans are not white! If I see someone kill, then I can be practically certain that he is a criminal. If I don’t see him kill, I cannot be certain that he is innocent. The same applies to cancer detection: the finding of a single malignant tumor proves that you have cancer, but the absence of such a finding cannot allow you to say with certainty that you are cancer-free.

Offer a rationale for why the task is necessary. A job that’s not inherently interesting can become more meaningful, and therefore more engaging, if it’s part of a larger purpose. Explain why this poster is so important and why sending it out now is critical to your organization’s mission. • Acknowledge that the task is boring. This is an act of empathy, of course. And the acknowledgment will help people understand why this is the rare instance when “if-then” rewards are part of how your organization operates. • Allow people to complete the task their own way. Think autonomy, not control. State the outcome you need. But instead of specifying precisely the way to reach it—how each poster must be rolled and how each mailing label must be affixed—give them freedom over how they do the job.

That is, the team’s basic compensation must be adequate and fair—particularly compared with people doing similar work for similar organizations. Your nonprofit must be a congenial place to work. And the people on your team must have autonomy, they must have ample opportunity to pursue mastery, and their daily duties must relate to a larger purpose.

I’d had plenty of experience with being scared and knowing I was scared. What made this different was that I was able to see my thoughts for what they were: just thoughts, with no concrete reality.

At places that are most vehement and effective at enforcing the no asshole rule, “employee performance” and “treatment of others” aren’t separate things. Phrases like “talented jerk,” “brilliant bastard,” or “an asshole and a superstar” are seen as oxymorons. Temporary assholes are dealt with immediately: they quickly realize (or are told) that they have blown it, apologize, reflect on their nastiness, ask for forgiveness, and work to change—rather than justify or glorify—their actions. Certified assholes aren’t ignored or forgiven again and again; they change or are sent packing. At the places where I want to work, even if people do other things well (even extraordinary well) but routinely demean others, they are seen as incompetent.

The initialism stood for “mind in boat.” It was meant as a reminder that from the time an oarsman steps into a racing shell until the moment that the boat crosses the finish line, he must keep his mind focused on what is happening inside the boat. His whole world must shrink down to the small space within the gunwales. He must maintain a singular focus on the rower just ahead of him and the voice of the coxswain calling out commands. Nothing outside the boat—not the boat in the next lane over, not the cheering of a crowd of spectators, not last night’s date—can enter the successful oarsman’s mind. But no amount of chanting “M-I-B” seemed to be working for the freshmen. Bolles decided he needed to tinker with the fundamentals of the boat, the mechanics of what made it go—or not go.

By using schemas, Explanation 2 improves both our comprehension and our memory. Let’s think about the two definitions of “pomelo” in terms of the inverted pyramid structure. What’s the lead? Well, with Explanation 1 the lead is: citrus fruit. After the lead, there is no clear hierarchy; depending on what catches people’s attention, they might remember the rind info (“very thick but soft and easy to peel away”) or the color info (“light yellow to coral pink”) or the juiciness info or the taste info.

So, a good process for making your ideas stickier is: (1) Identify the central message you need to communicate—find the core; (2) Figure out what is counterintuitive about the message—i.e., What are the unexpected implications of your core message? Why isn’t it already happening naturally? (3) Communicate your message in a way that breaks your audience’s guessing machines along the critical, counterintuitive dimension. Then, once their guessing machines have failed, help them refine their machines.

In this way, Nordstrom breaks through the complacency of common sense. Instead of spreading stories about “Nordies,” Nordstrom could simply tell its employees that its mission is to provide “the best customer service in the industry.” This statement may be true, but, unfortunately, it sounds like something that JCPenney or Sears might also tell its employees. To make a message stick, you’ve got to push it beyond common sense to uncommon sense. “Great customer service” is common sense. Warming customers’ cars in the winter is uncommon sense.

Hell, you don’t even get to be born unless your mother has the courage to have you. I repeat this phrase when I’m anxious or nervous about something. I ask myself, what’s the worst that can happen. Usually, the answer is, “You can die.” Then I answer back, “I’d rather die doing something I feel is great and amazing rather than be safe and comfortable living a life I hate.”

Am I spending enough time on looking for, finding, and working toward winning a great job? Am I constantly refining and improving my skills? What can I continue to get better and more competitive at? Do I believe that I am working harder than everyone else? If not, what else can I be doing? What are the people who are competing with me doing that I am not doing? Am I doing everything I can—every single day—to stay in “career shape”? If not, what else should I be doing?

Make sure I’m dedicating my time to the right people with the question, “Is this someone I might be thinking about when I’m on my deathbed?” Make sure I’m spending enough high-quality time with the people I care about most with the question, “If I were on my deathbed today, would I be happy with the amount of time I spent with this person?” An alternative is thinking about other people’s deathbeds—“If X person were on their deathbed today, how would I feel about the amount of quality time I’ve spent with them?”

Life will go faster than you know. It will be tempting to live a life that impresses others. But this is the wrong path. The right path is to know that life is short, every day is a gift, and you have certain gifts. Happiness is about understanding that the gift of life should be honored every day by offering your gifts to the world. Don’t let yourself define what matters by the dogma of other people’s thoughts. And even more important, don’t let the thoughts of self-doubt and chattering self-criticism in your own mind slow you down. You will likely be your own worst critic. Be kind to yourself in your own mind. Let your mind show you the same kindness that you aspire to show others.

the living room, their bedroom, then the bedroom that would be her children’s when they visited. He envisioned for her how each room would look. The house was exactly as he had described it, a place where shelter and nature were fused. She could picture how it would be when it was finished. How guests would walk through the entryway with its low ceiling that compressed down the space, making them feel a kind of tension. How they would suddenly, physically, feel that tension lift and joy replace it as they entered the expansive living room with its wide-open vistas of sky and green land as far as the eye could see. What the eye saw now, though, was bare studs and lath board. Holes where doors and windows were to be placed. Vats for mixing plaster. Bags of sand. Sawhorses. And, everywhere, dust. Wood dust. Plaster dust. Dirt dust. Frank saw the question on her face. “In a few weeks…” “Where will we sleep?” “At Jennie’s.” “But…” She didn’t speak out loud what she was thinking. Stay in the house where Jennie’s children are, where their Aunt Catherine usually stayed when she came with Frank? In the same house with Anna Wright? As if on cue, Frank’s sister Jennie stepped through one of the openings, carrying a basket of lunch. She set it down on the floor, then came over and extended her hand. “Mamah,” she said warmly, “how good to meet you.” Mamah’s knees nearly buckled in gratitude. Frank had said Jennie would be kind. She was a pretty version of Frank’s mother, her dark hair parted and pulled tight at the nape of her neck. No one would mistake her for Frank’s sister, though. She had a shy manner, countered by penetrating dark eyes that stared at the speaker a moment too long, as if there were a deeper meaning to be had just below the surface of a remark. “I have a room all ready for you up at the house,” she said. “I think tonight we will stay here,” Frank said. “On the floor? Are you sure?” Jennie’s eyes studied his. “I’ll set up the bed I’ve got stored in the shed.” “All right, then, if you insist. We’ll see you in the morning.” Watching Frank’s sister step through piles of lumber as she headed back to her house, Mamah felt relief. “That wasn’t so hard,” she said. “It has to be strange for her.” “Count her as a friend.” Mamah and Frank walked down to the Wisconsin River below the house, followed by the dog. The rain had stopped. Along the river, peeling white birches shed bark like dead skin, revealing patches of pink underneath. Mamah and Frank ate the sandwiches Jennie had brought them, and watched the men load wheelbarrows full of sand. After a time, they walked back up the hill behind the workmen. Out in the courtyard, men stirred sand, lime, and water into a brown “mud” mix. A young plasterer carried a bucket inside and spread some onto a stretch of wall in the living room as an undercoat. While it was drying, Frank went to the car and retrieved some pigments he had bought in the city. He poured ocher and umber in varying amounts in different buckets of plaster, making an array of shades for use on different walls, “depending on the light they get,” he told the plasterer, who had watched the mixing cautiously. “How will you get the same color again if you don’t measure and write it down?” the plasterer asked. “You’ve got six formulas going there.” “I don’t have to fall into a vat of dye to know what color it is,” Frank said. “I can look at the shade on the wall and remix it.” The plasterer raised his eyebrows, impressed. Mamah spent the rest of the day helping move her boxes into a shed for storage, then cleaning, cleaning, trying to get the dust and debris out of the bedroom they were to sleep in. There were no windows in it yet. “Organic, indeed,” she teased Frank as she made up the bed. That night when they lay down, Frank put out his arm to hold her. He pointed out Orion’s Belt through the open hole in the wall, then fell almost immediately to sleep. During the night, she got up to use the bucket he had placed by her side of the bed. As she lifted her nightgown to crouch, a bat whipped by within inches of her shoulder. She leaped back into bed and covered her head with the blanket. Frank turned in his sleep, muttered, “Heigh-ho,” then commenced snoring. CHAPTER 35 “Well, shit. If that don’t beat all.” “That’s what he said. She’s the one in charge when he ain’t here.” “He ain’t here a lot.” “He’ll be around more now she’s here. She’s a looker.” “Shit, Murphy, you better not be lookin’.” Mamah could hear the men moving around in the living room. Something dragged across the wood floor. “Gad, I overslept.” Frank sat up and swung his legs around. “They don’t know we’re here,” he said as he reached for his trousers. She grabbed his arm. “Shhh. It’s all right,” she whispered. “Don’t say a word to them.” She knew Billy’s voice but had no faces for the other two. “I don’t need a woman telling me how to drive a fuckin’ nail.” Sawing drowned out their voices before they rose again. “Don’t saw when you’re mad, Billy. You’re gonna cut off another finger.” “Oh, he ain’t done that in near a month.” Laughter. “At least my pecker ain’t been cut off, like some I know.” “THERE ARE THIRTY-SIX of them now,” Jennie Porter said. “It changes up or down, depending on what Frank’s working on. During the week, they sleep in shacks around here, then they go home on weekends.” The two women stood between the kitchen table and the cooking range. Jennie and her son, Frankie, rolled chunks of beef in flour, then tossed them into sizzling oil in an iron pot. “Frank hired a woman from town to do the cooking, but it’s too much for one person,” Jennie said. “Somebody has to get things half ready for her, so the big meal can go on around one.” “Frankie,” she said, “show Miz Borthwick where the carrots are, will you?” That one sentence confirmed what Mamah had suspected. She was the somebody who would be taking over food duty from Jennie. It was only right, of course. It wasn’t Jennie’s house they were building, Mamah thought as she pulled up carrots and potatoes from the big garden next to the Porters’ house. She didn’t mind the idea of riding herd over the operation, but she knew almost nothing about cooking. “It’s written down,” Jennie assured her. “All my recipes feed forty now.” AS A TEN-YEAR-OLD returning to Boone for a visit, Mamah had gone with a cousin and aunt out into the fields during harvest. They rode in a wagon laden with bowls covered by dish towels. When they found the men, they set up the pots and jugs along the back of the wagon so the farmhands could fill their own plates. Mamah remembered her job that day—ladeling stew into tin cups. Even as a young girl, she had been stunned by how much food went into those men’s mouths. “Harvest” was all her mother had said when Mamah described the scene once she got home. In Iowa everyone knew what that meant—men bent over pulling and hacking, tending horses, working their hands raw. Women doing the same in the kitchen—cooking, cooking, and then cooking some more. Mamah ran Jennie Porter’s kitchen as if it were harvest time at Taliesin. There were two main meals, not one, as it turned out. The men ate oatmeal for breakfast, with plenty of coffee. At midday they ate heaps of stew and biscuits. At night they consumed another big meal—chicken, mashed potatoes, something green. Seconds of everything, and then dessert. Lil, the tired-looking Spring Green cook, arrived from town every day with fresh supplies from the grocer. Only occasionally did they raid Jennie’s garden—there weren’t enough potatoes or greens in the plot for so many people. Mamah began dessert before Lil arrived. Usually, it was coconut cake or yellow cake with cocoa frosting, the two items she had mastered as a housewife. She had never been expected—none of the women she knew in Oak Park were expected—to have more than one specialty. A married woman in Mamah’s circle needed to master just one dish to trot out at dinner parties or to deliver to ailing friends. Everything else was done by a cook or house girl. Lil taught Mamah the subtleties of pie crust—how you forked the lard, salt, and flour into just the right crumbly mix before you added very cold water. How you pressed your left thumb up and your index fingers down to make a handsome crimped edge. The first week of meals, the workmen hardly spoke to her. Mamah, Lil, and Jennie hung back, watching as the men devoured one large pot of victuals after another. Mamah had placed a glass vase of flowers on the table and was pained by the amused looks the men shot at one another upon discovering the new frivolity. They ate the cakes and grunted their approval nonetheless, always saying “thank you” when they stood up. But that was all. “Pie crusts,” she would say to Frank weeks later when he asked her at what point the men had begun actually conversing with her. It went without explanation, like “harvest.” Frank knew the value of a good pie crust in the Wisconsin countryside. A woman didn’t want to be known for making a bad one. But a woman who could make a really good one—now, that was worth something. “LAST SUNDAY OUR preacher warned about consorting with people who live in sin. He didn’t name no names, but…” Mamah stood in the kitchen at the new house. In the days since her arrival, the kitchen had become a higher priority. It had been cleaned up, and she’d found a block of marble for a pastry board. She was rolling out her crusts there when the voices outside the window began. This time she recognized the young one. It belonged to a sweet-faced workman from a town a few miles over, newly married. “You worry about the damnedest things,” she heard Murphy say in his thick Irish brogue. “Well, people are talking.” “You’re gone five days a week from that little girl of yours, Jimmy. She’s over there alone in Mineral Point with all them Cornish stonemasons. I’d be worryin’ about that, if I was you. Any man knows what a new bride wants. A good stiff prick as far-r-r-r as it will go.” Men laughed wildly out in the yard. People are talking. It was to be expected. She had slipped into their midst, and not without notice. Frank had purposely resisted introducing her by name, even to Billy. But the men had only to observe how Frank treated her to know she was more than a housekeeper to him. They addressed her as “ma’am,” if they spoke to her at all. “I’m sorry it has to be this way. You understand, don’t you?” Frank said to her later. “A newspaper story would be disastrous at this point. It’s not just our hides. Aunt Nell and Aunt Jennie are sensitive about publicity, what with their school nearby. I’m sure that’s why they and the rest of the Lloyd Joneses are keeping their distance.” The locals probably knew there was a stranger among them—a particular stranger. Once, while riding out in the fields on Frank’s horse, Mamah had come upon two farmers cutting across the property. They had stopped to look at her, and she’d pulled her hat down and ridden off rather than greet them, for fear of making her identity known. There would come a time when she would have to be presented officially in the community. In the back of her mind, she kept hoping that Catherine would agree to a divorce. Then Mamah and Frank would marry, though they both said it was not a necessity. But how much easier it would make life to have that piece of parchment. For the time being, she avoided any car trips into Spring Green. When she decided work shoes were the only solution for the mud around the construction site, Frank took one of her shoes into town and bought a pair of men’s heavy boots for her. The second week of her stay at Taliesin, Frank departed for his Chicago office. He had a project on his drawing table, a summerhouse in Minnesota for old clients, the Littles, that would bring in desperately needed money. He left on a Saturday, so as to visit his children. On Sunday morning Mamah rose to have breakfast with Jennie and her husband Andrew, their children, and Anna Wright. Frank’s mother had avoided Mamah as much as possible, disappearing into her room at the Porters’ house for long periods during the day. Now they sat across the table from each other as Jennie slid eggs onto their plates. “She won’t eat eggs,” Anna Wright said. She was thin, erect, and stern-looking, with steel-gray hair wrapped in a tight bun at her neck. Everything about her was sour, even her breath. Mamah realized Anna was talking about her. The woman’s lips were pressed together in a thin line. The puckered skin just below the corners of her mouth was a measure of the offense Anna took at her presence. “Oh, I will today,” Mamah said quickly. Anna looked just to the side of her face as she spoke. “There’s too much work not to eat.” Feeling chastised, Mamah salted and peppered the eggs on her plate. “I don’t believe in pepper,” Anna said. “Frank won’t touch pepper. It’s bad for the digestion.” At least she didn’t call me Mrs. Cheney, Mamah later reflected, the way she had the first week whenever Frank was out of earshot. “Anna, I have changed my name legally to Borthwick,” Mamah told her when it happened the third time. Now the old woman, like the workers, didn’t call her anything. It didn’t take much cleverness to understand how the Wright family worked. Anna treated Jennie with a matter-of-fact familiarity. But when Frank entered the room, something in her seemed to brighten. She asked him questions as if he were a visiting celebrity, her cheeks—those sagging pockets—lifting at the sight of him. Mamah knew her to be an intelligent woman, even witty; she had seen her present at the club in Oak Park. That Anna, cofounder of the Nineteenth Century Woman’s Club, “Madame Wright,” as she introduced herself, inhabited her body when Frank appeared. She pampered him, making up special plates of food for him, pointing out articles she’d read and wanted to share with him. And she told endless anecdotes about his childhood while he sat at the table chuckling at the old stories as if he were genuinely amused. Frank’s sisters, Jennie and Maginel, usually appeared as accessories in the tales, yet even Jennie smiled at the old stories. Frank had grown up among women, and they all adored him. His sisters and Anna—especially Anna—had doted on him since he’d first appeared. Mamah felt like a mature bride coming into a household where the groom has long been the apple of the mother’s eye. It was a new experience, since Edwin’s mother had always deferred to her, for some reason. Frank had prepared Mamah to be accepted by his mother, but that was clearly wishful thinking on his part. Even Mamah had imagined better relations, though. She had romanticized Anna as a wise mother—the kind of woman who let her child’s temperament and interests guide how she educated him. Having spent only a few hours with Anna, though, she wondered how on earth she was going to tolerate sharing a house with her, for Frank had earmarked one of the bedrooms in their home for his mother. THE NEXT DAY, Monday, was so humid and witheringly hot, it put everyone in a bad temper. Mamah was making bread and pies when Frank’s mother appeared in the kitchen. She landed a long cold stare on Mamah when she saw her rolling out crust. Anna didn’t believe in sugar except as it could be used in some home remedy, cough syrup, perhaps. She had expressed more than once the notion that “people” harmed others’ health by baking pies and cakes. Mamah had thought the grainy bread would please her, since it was from one of her own recipes. But the old woman gave no sign of approval when she saw it go into the oven. Anna was boiling coffee when Lil arrived with the day’s supplies from town. When Mamah and the cook carried six boxes of produce into the house, Frank’s mother went straight to the vegetables to examine them. “You can’t have paid actual money for this terrible cabbage,” she said, her voice as caustic as acid. “It’s full of bugs.” “It’s all they had,” Lil said. “It’s a Monday. The food came in on Saturday.” “You didn’t pay full price for that, did you?” “Yes.” “You bargain when it’s like this,” Anna snapped, “or you don’t buy it.” Lil stopped in her tracks. “That’s all there was. What would the men eat if I didn’t buy it?” Anna didn’t respond. She poked around the boxes further. “What is this?” She held up some onions. “They’re damp, like they’ve been sitting in water.” She picked up a bunch of small turnips with wilted greens. “How did you manage to find old vegetables in September? These have mold on them.” Lil glared at the old woman. “Then we’ll peel off the skins.” The remark infuriated Anna, who threw the turnips into the garbage barrel. “Anybody knows the skin’s the most important part.” Lil’s eyes were puffy little slits that gave her face a dull look, but Mamah knew she wasn’t stupid. She was like a lot of country women, red-knuckled from a life of soapsuds and bone-grinding work. Tired out, maybe, but not someone you could push over. Lil pulled out the grocery bill from her pocket and slammed it on the counter. “You owe me five dollars.” She met Anna’s seething look with one of her own. “Well,” Anna replied, “we shall see what Mr. Wright has to say about that. I, for one, don’t reimburse bad judgment.” Lil took off her apron and threw it on the floor. She stormed out the door and leaped into her truck. Mamah watched as the battered vehicle trailed a funnel cloud of brown dust down the road and out to the highway. “Good riddance,” Anna muttered when Mamah came back into the kitchen. She put on an old apron and began moving briskly around the stifling room. “We’ll have chicken stew tonight for dinner,” she said with the slightest hint of cheer in her voice. She went out into the dooryard, lifted a hatchet from its hook, then headed for the chicken coop. When she returned a half hour later, she carried six headless carcasses in the sling of her bloody apron, which she held with one hand. A fistful of herbs was in the other. The contretemps with Lil seemed to have elevated her spirits, because she began talking, apparently to Mamah, as she was the only other person in the kitchen. “People will take advantage of you when they can, even in the country,” Anna said, her voice thick still with a Welsh accent. “Especially if they take you for an outsider.” Anna smirked as she ripped feathers out of the birds. “That woman doesn’t know who she’s talking to.” She wiped sweat off her upper lip with her sleeve. “If she did, she wouldn’t try to get away with that nonsense. She probably got a decent price and is trying to gouge us.” Mamah cleared her throat and tried to change the subject. “Frank told me your father settled this land.” Anna looked up from her work and gazed past Mamah’s face again. “My father…” She paused, as if deciding whether to sully her father’s story by telling it to Mamah. “My father had nothing when he came here.” Her head was shaking a little, as if palsied by indignation. “Nothing. Except a wife and passel of children who could work. They were driven out of Wales by religious persecution.” “They were Unitarian preachers, weren’t they?” “You couldn’t live by just that. The Lloyd Joneses were farmers, some of them. A hatmaker, my father was. Great men. Brilliant men. But they were misunderstood back in Wales, treated like heretics by their own people. Because they weren’t afraid to think for themselves. My father was forced to leave the village church because he questioned the divinity of Christ. Most doctrines can’t abide questioners. And my father opened his mouth. He spoke what he believed.” She shook her head. “Oh, the persecution he and Mother endured.” “So they left,” Mamah said. “My father had a sister in Wisconsin. At first all we had was our hands and backs. One baby didn’t make it—died on the trip out here from New York.” Anna was washing the blood from the apron in cold water. “In time the Lloyd Joneses owned this whole valley.” Anna went out of the kitchen, leaving the big pot steaming. THERE WAS NO REASON to expect Frank’s mother to ever come around. Mamah remembered Catherine’s story of her wedding day. Anna Wright had behaved as if she were at a funeral, fainting during the ceremony. She’d been at constant odds with her daughter-in-law ever since. Yet she had stayed near Frank the whole time. When he set off from Wisconsin as a young man to seek his fortune in Chicago, Anna had followed him within a year or so, moving with her two daughters to live nearby. Actually, to be supported by him. He’d built a house for her on Chicago Avenue next door to his own. She had settled into Oak Park and carved out a life for herself as Madame Wright, mother of the brilliant architect. It occurred to Mamah that Frank had never been without his mother close by, except for the one year in Europe. For all the adoration Frank enjoyed in his family, he’d been a beast of burden since he was nineteen or twenty. Standing in the kitchen peeling potatoes, Mamah could easily piece together how things had unfolded recently. Anna Wright had come up here and bought this land for Frank because she knew him well enough to see that he wasn’t going to stay with Catherine. Where would that leave her, living next door to the daughter-in-law he had left behind? No, the mother had to throw her lot in with the son once more, out of loyalty, surely, but also because she had no other options. To judge by what Mamah could glean from Frank’s meager details, Anna Wright had made a bad bet in the one big gamble of her life. When she’d married, she had settled on a widowed preacher with a charming personality and a gift for music.

the living room, their bedroom, then the bedroom that would be her children’s when they visited. He envisioned for her how each room would look. The house was exactly as he had described it, a place where shelter and nature were fused. She could picture how it would be when it was finished. How guests would walk through the entryway with its low ceiling that compressed down the space, making them feel a kind of tension. How they would suddenly, physically, feel that tension lift and joy replace it as they entered the expansive living room with its wide-open vistas of sky and green land as far as the eye could see. What the eye saw now, though, was bare studs and lath board. Holes where doors and windows were to be placed. Vats for mixing plaster. Bags of sand. Sawhorses. And, everywhere, dust. Wood dust. Plaster dust. Dirt dust. Frank saw the question on her face. “In a few weeks…” “Where will we sleep?” “At Jennie’s.” “But…” She didn’t speak out loud what she was thinking. Stay in the house where Jennie’s children are, where their Aunt Catherine usually stayed when she came with Frank? In the same house with Anna Wright? As if on cue, Frank’s sister Jennie stepped through one of the openings, carrying a basket of lunch. She set it down on the floor, then came over and extended her hand. “Mamah,” she said warmly, “how good to meet you.” Mamah’s knees nearly buckled in gratitude. Frank had said Jennie would be kind. She was a pretty version of Frank’s mother, her dark hair parted and pulled tight at the nape of her neck. No one would mistake her for Frank’s sister, though. She had a shy manner, countered by penetrating dark eyes that stared at the speaker a moment too long, as if there were a deeper meaning to be had just below the surface of a remark. “I have a room all ready for you up at the house,” she said. “I think tonight we will stay here,” Frank said. “On the floor? Are you sure?” Jennie’s eyes studied his. “I’ll set up the bed I’ve got stored in the shed.” “All right, then, if you insist. We’ll see you in the morning.” Watching Frank’s sister step through piles of lumber as she headed back to her house, Mamah felt relief. “That wasn’t so hard,” she said. “It has to be strange for her.” “Count her as a friend.” Mamah and Frank walked down to the Wisconsin River below the house, followed by the dog. The rain had stopped. Along the river, peeling white birches shed bark like dead skin, revealing patches of pink underneath. Mamah and Frank ate the sandwiches Jennie had brought them, and watched the men load wheelbarrows full of sand. After a time, they walked back up the hill behind the workmen. Out in the courtyard, men stirred sand, lime, and water into a brown “mud” mix. A young plasterer carried a bucket inside and spread some onto a stretch of wall in the living room as an undercoat. While it was drying, Frank went to the car and retrieved some pigments he had bought in the city. He poured ocher and umber in varying amounts in different buckets of plaster, making an array of shades for use on different walls, “depending on the light they get,” he told the plasterer, who had watched the mixing cautiously. “How will you get the same color again if you don’t measure and write it down?” the plasterer asked. “You’ve got six formulas going there.” “I don’t have to fall into a vat of dye to know what color it is,” Frank said. “I can look at the shade on the wall and remix it.” The plasterer raised his eyebrows, impressed. Mamah spent the rest of the day helping move her boxes into a shed for storage, then cleaning, cleaning, trying to get the dust and debris out of the bedroom they were to sleep in. There were no windows in it yet. “Organic, indeed,” she teased Frank as she made up the bed. That night when they lay down, Frank put out his arm to hold her. He pointed out Orion’s Belt through the open hole in the wall, then fell almost immediately to sleep. During the night, she got up to use the bucket he had placed by her side of the bed. As she lifted her nightgown to crouch, a bat whipped by within inches of her shoulder. She leaped back into bed and covered her head with the blanket. Frank turned in his sleep, muttered, “Heigh-ho,” then commenced snoring. CHAPTER 35 “Well, shit. If that don’t beat all.” “That’s what he said. She’s the one in charge when he ain’t here.” “He ain’t here a lot.” “He’ll be around more now she’s here. She’s a looker.” “Shit, Murphy, you better not be lookin’.” Mamah could hear the men moving around in the living room. Something dragged across the wood floor. “Gad, I overslept.” Frank sat up and swung his legs around. “They don’t know we’re here,” he said as he reached for his trousers. She grabbed his arm. “Shhh. It’s all right,” she whispered. “Don’t say a word to them.” She knew Billy’s voice but had no faces for the other two. “I don’t need a woman telling me how to drive a fuckin’ nail.” Sawing drowned out their voices before they rose again. “Don’t saw when you’re mad, Billy. You’re gonna cut off another finger.” “Oh, he ain’t done that in near a month.” Laughter. “At least my pecker ain’t been cut off, like some I know.” “THERE ARE THIRTY-SIX of them now,” Jennie Porter said. “It changes up or down, depending on what Frank’s working on. During the week, they sleep in shacks around here, then they go home on weekends.” The two women stood between the kitchen table and the cooking range. Jennie and her son, Frankie, rolled chunks of beef in flour, then tossed them into sizzling oil in an iron pot. “Frank hired a woman from town to do the cooking, but it’s too much for one person,” Jennie said. “Somebody has to get things half ready for her, so the big meal can go on around one.” “Frankie,” she said, “show Miz Borthwick where the carrots are, will you?” That one sentence confirmed what Mamah had suspected. She was the somebody who would be taking over food duty from Jennie. It was only right, of course. It wasn’t Jennie’s house they were building, Mamah thought as she pulled up carrots and potatoes from the big garden next to the Porters’ house. She didn’t mind the idea of riding herd over the operation, but she knew almost nothing about cooking. “It’s written down,” Jennie assured her. “All my recipes feed forty now.” AS A TEN-YEAR-OLD returning to Boone for a visit, Mamah had gone with a cousin and aunt out into the fields during harvest.

She put on an old apron and began moving briskly around the stifling room. “We’ll have chicken stew tonight for dinner,” she said with the slightest hint of cheer in her voice. She went out into the dooryard, lifted a hatchet from its hook, then headed for the chicken coop. When she returned a half hour later, she carried six headless carcasses in the sling of her bloody apron, which she held with one hand. A fistful of herbs was in the other. The contretemps with Lil seemed to have elevated her spirits, because she began talking, apparently to Mamah, as she was the only other person in the kitchen. “People will take advantage of you when they can, even in the country,” Anna said, her voice thick still with a Welsh accent. “Especially if they take you for an outsider.” Anna smirked as she ripped feathers out of the birds. “That woman doesn’t know who she’s talking to.” She wiped sweat off her upper lip with her sleeve. “If she did, she wouldn’t try to get away with that nonsense. She probably got a decent price and is trying to gouge us.” Mamah cleared her throat and tried to change the subject. “Frank told me your father settled this land.” Anna looked up from her work and gazed past Mamah’s face again. “My father…” She paused, as if deciding whether to sully her father’s story by telling it to Mamah. “My father had nothing when he came here.” Her head was shaking a little, as if palsied by indignation. “Nothing. Except a wife and passel of children who could work. They were driven out of Wales by religious persecution.” “They were Unitarian preachers, weren’t they?” “You couldn’t live by just that. The Lloyd Joneses were farmers, some of them. A hatmaker, my father was. Great men. Brilliant men. But they were misunderstood back in Wales, treated like heretics by their own people. Because they weren’t afraid to think for themselves. My father was forced to leave the village church because he questioned the divinity of Christ. Most doctrines can’t abide questioners. And my father opened his mouth. He spoke what he believed.” She shook her head. “Oh, the persecution he and Mother endured.” “So they left,” Mamah said. “My father had a sister in Wisconsin. At first all we had was our hands and backs. One baby didn’t make it—died on the trip out here from New York.” Anna was washing the blood from the apron in cold water. “In time the Lloyd Joneses owned this whole valley.” Anna went out of the kitchen, leaving the big pot steaming. THERE WAS NO REASON to expect Frank’s mother to ever come around. Mamah remembered Catherine’s story of her wedding day. Anna Wright had behaved as if she were at a funeral, fainting during the ceremony. She’d been at constant odds with her daughter-in-law ever since. Yet she had stayed near Frank the whole time. When he set off from Wisconsin as a young man to seek his fortune in Chicago, Anna had followed him within a year or so, moving with her two daughters to live nearby. Actually, to be supported by him. He’d built a house for her on Chicago Avenue next door to his own. She had settled into Oak Park and carved out a life for herself as Madame Wright, mother of the brilliant architect. It occurred to Mamah that Frank had never been without his mother close by, except for the one year in Europe. For all the adoration Frank enjoyed in his family, he’d been a beast of burden since he was nineteen or twenty. Standing in the kitchen peeling potatoes, Mamah could easily piece together how things had unfolded recently. Anna Wright had come up here and bought this land for Frank because she knew him well enough to see that he wasn’t going to stay with Catherine. Where would that leave her, living next door to the daughter-in-law he had left behind? No, the mother had to throw her lot in with the son once more, out of loyalty, surely, but also because she had no other options. To judge by what Mamah could glean from Frank’s meager details, Anna Wright had made a bad bet in the one big gamble of her life. When she’d married, she had settled on a widowed preacher with a charming personality and a gift for music.

It is equally impossible for greed or desire to coexist with inner freedom. Desire can fully develop only when it is allowed to run rampant to the point where it monopolizes the mind. The trap here is the fact that desire, and its ally pleasure, are not ugly like hatred. They are even extremely seductive. But the silken threads of desire, which seem so light at first, soon tighten, and the soft garment they had woven becomes a straitjacket. The more you struggle, the tighter it becomes. In the worst cases, desire can drive us continuously to seek satisfaction at any cost; the more satisfaction seems to elude us, the more it obsesses us. On the other hand, when we contemplate its disturbing aspects and turn our minds toward developing inner calm, the obsession of desire can begin to melt like snow in the sun. Make no mistake—there’s no question here of ceasing to love those whose lives we share, or of becoming indifferent to them. When we stop projecting the insatiable demands of our attachments onto people, we are able to love them more and to feel genuine concern for their true well-being. As for anger, it can

The theory of Tipping Points requires, however, that we reframe the way we think about the world. I have spent a lot of time, in this book, talking about the idiosyncrasies of the way we relate to new information and to each other. We have trouble estimating dramatic, exponential change. We cannot conceive that a piece of paper folded over 50 times could reach the sun. There are abrupt limits to the number of cognitive categories we can make and the number of people we can truly love and the number of acquaintances we can truly know. We throw up our hands at a problem phrased in an abstract way, but have no difficulty at all solving the same problem rephrased as a social dilemma. All of these things are expressions of the peculiarities of the human mind and heart, a refutation of the notion that the way we function and communicate and process information is

As Pico Iyer pointed out, the act of quitting “means not giving up, but moving on; changing direction not because something doesn’t agree with you, but because you don’t agree with something. It’s not a complaint, in other words, but a positive choice, and not a stop in one’s journey, but a step in a better direction. Quitting—whether a job or a habit—means taking a turn so as to be sure you’re still moving in the direction of your dreams.”

But Xerxes failed, as is the habit of hedgehogs, to establish a proper relationship between his ends and his means. Because ends exist only in the imagination, they can be infinite: a throne on the moon, perhaps, with a great view. Means, though, are stubbornly finite: they’re boots on the ground, ships in the sea, and the bodies required to fill them. Ends and means have to connect if anything is to happen. They’re never, however, interchangeable.

That’s where proportionality—the simultaneous comprehension of contradictions76—comes from. Theory versus practice. Training versus improvisation. Planning versus friction. Force versus policy. Situations versus sketches. Specialization versus generalization. Action versus inaction. Victory versus defeat. Love versus hate. Life versus death.

By general law life and limb must be protected; yet often a limb must be amputated to save a life; but a life is never wisely given to save a limb. I felt that measures, otherwise unconstitutional, might become lawful, by becoming indispensable to the preservation of the nation. Right or wrong, I assumed this ground, and now avow it.70 Lincoln here stated, more clearly than Clausewitz, a Clausewitzian fundamental: that it made no sense to save a part while losing the whole.

But Xerxes failed, as is the habit of hedgehogs, to establish a proper relationship between his ends and his means. Because ends exist only in the imagination, they can be infinite: a throne on the moon, perhaps, with a great view. Means, though, are stubbornly finite: they’re boots on the ground, ships in the sea, and the bodies required to fill them. Ends and means have to connect if anything is to happen. They’re never, however, interchangeable.

Likewise, if we believe that something is very good and desirable, we become anxious when it’s threatened or sad if it has already been lost. For example, in order to feel social anxiety, you have to believe that other people’s negative opinions of you are worth getting upset about, that it’s really bad if they dislike you and really important to win their approval. Even people who suffer from severe social anxiety disorder (social phobia) tend to feel “normal” when speaking to children or to their close friends about trivial matters, with a few exceptions. Nevertheless, they feel highly anxious when talking to people they think are very important about subjects they think are very important. If your fundamental worldview, by contrast, assumes that your status in the eyes of others is of negligible importance, then it follows that you should be beyond the reach of social anxiety.

Sticking to the facts can, by itself, often reduce your anxiety. Cognitive therapists use the neologism “catastrophizing,” or dwelling on the worst-case scenario, to help explain to clients how we project our values onto external events. They turn the noun “catastrophe” into a verb to help clients remember that viewing events in this way is actually an activity they’re engaged in. Catastrophizing is also a form of rhetorical hyperbole, or exaggeration.

We meet an old friend at a college reunion who has written a bestselling book, and we wonder how, in all the time that has passed, we’ve accomplished so little. Amid this anxiety and self-flagellation, we forget that doing really good work—work that endures, work that makes the world better, and work that offers abiding satisfaction—takes time and the mileage of experience.

They didn’t engineer these moments; with one exception, none saw disaster coming; and none suspected that they’d be brought to their knees by the difficulties they faced. But once each found themselves in what Bonhoeffer called a “boundary situation,” they understood they had to navigate through the moment to endure. They didn’t do this by grand design, but instead point to point, with each individual taking a single step forward into the turbulence and then taking the next step after that.

Thomas Piketty estimates that in modern European countries, 40 percent of the population controls between 45 percent and 25 percent of national wealth. The appearance of this middle class was a new phenomenon in human history. And more and more people are joining the new middle class as the numbers living in extreme poverty fall.
